### Wearing the Cape - Skills

- Attribute bonuses before the roll only apply to skills, not directly used attributes.
- Physique and Willpower are only used directly to perform (or Counter against) Overcomes or Create an Advantages, unless a stunt adds an action. When Attacking or Defending, they may add WR and AR bonuses as long as the attribute or its bonuses were not used before the roll.
- Alertness is used to aim kinesis (object movement, force blasts, force fields, etc) as if it were a ranged weapon. Discernment increases the success of telepathy and magic through comprehension of thoughts, feelings, and forces of magic.
- Kinetics, telepaths, and modern magic users who rely on inner strength buff the Willpower attribute. Classic magic users who perform incantations to create wards and magical objects buff the Discernment attribute.
