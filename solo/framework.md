## Emulator
These are what I use for answering questions.
- Oracle from **Motif Story Engine** for questions about the story (GM targeted questions).
- Oracle from **Motif Character Engine** for questions about character actions (player targeted questions).
- **Commonsense** for picking an item from a list of possible outcomes using a combination of logic and chance.
- Meaning tables from **Mythic Magazine Vol.18** as a muse for answering open questions and describing scenes. The following are some additional uses of the meaning tables:
	- Descriptions can be broken down into Adverb and Adjective. 
	- Actions can be broken down into Verb and Noun. 
	- The 9 Q's: 
		- *Conflict, Rise, Refocus:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *Catalyst, Twist, Revelation, Fall, Resolution:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *Showdown:* Adverb Adjective / Adjective Noun
	- Standard 5W+H questions:
		- *Who, Where:* Adverb Adjective / Adjective Noun
		-  *What, When, Why:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *How:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
	- *Action/Event:* Verb Noun
	- *Topic/Theme:* Noun of Noun
	- *NPCs:* 1 Identity, 1 Descriptor, 3 Traits, 3 Motivations

## Rules & Tools
These are the tools that I use alongside the emulator to run my adventure.
- **The 9 Q's** for forcing a story structure on scenes and threads. I've labeled the story steps as: Conflict, Catalyst, Twist, Rise, Revelation, Fall, Refocus, Showdown, and Resolution.
- Randomized Location Crafter from **Mythic Magazine Vol.2** for exploring areas in a roguelike manner.
- **Cortex Prime** as a generic rule system. It can be as simple as representing a character with a single die or can scale up to be a deep and intricate system customized to suit the theme of the world and flavor or your game.

## Note Keeping
This is how I lay out my story summary page.
- The initial story *Summary*, which is about a paragraph.
- A list of *Anticipations* for tracking concepts or events that you want to see manifest in the game/story and is the primary reason that you are playing. This list should always have at least one incomplete item that you are working toward. I cross them out as they get fulfilled.
- A list of *Notes* to yourself about the game, like questions or potential problems that you need to figure out, or reminders to do things. I cross them out rather than deleting them once they no longer matter.
- A nested list of *Threads* happening in the game, described by important events and labeled by their associated 9 Q's story sections to help form a narrative arc.
- *Character List* and *Thread List* from **Mythic GME** for randomly selecting the story elements of your game when needed, but using the Adventure List version from *Mythic 2e* as described in **Mythic Magazine Vol.17**. 
- The *Characters* list, which are the character sheets and summaries of PCs and NPCs. This section is sometimes extracted into a separate file if it gets too large. 
	I generate a PC or NPC using the method described in the Meaning table section. I then write a short interpreted summary of that character (only a few sentences). The character's character sheet follows that. I usually use Cortex, Fate, or Calypso--I tend to stay away from systems with a ton of stats or ability lists--so the sheets are generally small.

The following is an example of my summary file.

> ## Summary
> The story takes place in the 19th century. The character is a vampire and must lead a young student to the coven. The character finds the child at the scene of a bloodbath and convinces them that they can lead them to safety. The character is completing this task because of an agreement that they made in the past.
