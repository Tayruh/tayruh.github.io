		<blockquote>
		  <p>I decided to not do the Set a Course move since I think being accompanied by Shadow Stalker would minimize the danger.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The walk to Grue's base is uneventful. Shadow Stalker and I keep our distance and don't say a word. She trails just a bit behind me as I lead the way, which leaves me with an itch between my shoulder blades. She may have become an apparent team member as of an hour ago, but I'd be an idiot to trust her at my back. Regardless, the bugs I have hidden on her body relay her every motion to me so I'm in no real danger, but the feeling remains.</p>
		<p>I sense Grue and Bitch with my bugs before I see them. They're both standing outside the entrance to his base. Bitch has two of her dogs with her. Angelica and Bastard, maybe? They're currently in their normal forms and collapsed happily at her feet.</p>
		<p>As we approach my teammates, Grue crosses his arms and fixes his gaze on Shadow Stalker. Bitch bristles beside him.</p>
		<p>"Hey, guys," I venture. "Tattletale tell you what's going on?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Grue has beef with Shadow Stalker but how is he handling this?<br>
		  <strong>Initial Disposition:</strong> [Threatening] Yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Yeah, I heard," Grue growls. "Shadow Stalker wants to join our team. And you two are okay with this?"</p>
		<p>Angelica growls, sensing Grue's tension. Bitch strokes the scruff on her neck and she calms.</p>
		<p>"Desperate times." I shrug. "Trust me, I have the strongest reasons for not wanting her on the team, or even in the same city, but I'm willing to put that aside to take out the Nine."</p>
		<p>Grue appears to glower at me behind his skull mask. "She shot me with a fucking arrow."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker snorts. I just shake my head. "That doesn't even compare to what she's done to me." </p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker smirks. That bitch.</p>
		<p>Grue holds up a hand. "Hold on. You have history with her? Why haven't I heard about this?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to get into it," I say firmly, shutting down that avenue of the conversation. "Are we okay here? We need her."</p>
		<p>Grue ponders the situation. He turns to Bitch who is squatting by her dogs, petting each of them. She catches him looking. "Don't ask me. I don't fucking care. Do what you want," she says.</p>
		<p>Grue huffs out a breath then points a finger at Shadow Stalker. "This is a trial period. You fuck us and we end you."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker laughs. "Yeah, okay. Just try it, fuckhead."</p>
		<p>"Guys, enough," I say, interrupting their childish posturing. "We'll have to run it by Coil after this mission anyway, so nothing is set in stone. Though I don't see why he'd turn down manpower."</p>
		<p>"He's not going to give her territory." Grue resumes crossing his arms grumpily.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. She's… Oh god..," I say as the realization hits me. Of course he wouldn't give her territory. The city is already evenly divided between us Undersiders and The Travelers. Any new members would have to be assigned to already existing territory, like how Grue shares with Imp. I bury my face in hands.  "I'm probably going to have to put her up."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker bursts out laughing. It's not a kind laugh. "I'm going to be rooming with Taylor? That's amazing!" She laughs some more.</p>
		<p>I peer out from my hands at her. "Just remember that I have hundreds of black widow spiders just a room away from where you'll be sleeping."</p>
		<p>Her laugher quiets quickly and she seems to once again be rethinking her enrollment.</p>
		<p>"She called you Taylor," Grue notes with suspicion. When I don't respond, he pieces together what I was alluding to earlier. He takes an angry step forward. "Is Shadow Stalker one of your bullies?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well…" I lower my gaze and clench my fists. "That doesn't matter right now."</p>
		<p>"This is fucked, Skitter." Grue paces. "And Tattletale agreed to this?" </p>
		<p>"You know her. She's willing to do something distasteful as long as it furthers her goal."</p>
		<p>Grue huffs. "Ain't that the truth."</p>
		<p>"Enough talk," Bitch grumbles. "If we're not doing anything, I'm going back to take care of my dogs."</p>
		<p>I nod. "I agree with Bitch. This matter has been settled and there's no point dwelling on it. Priority is trying to recruit The Pure against the Nine."</p>
		<p>"That's even worse than Shadow Stalker!" Grue groans in frustration. "Fuck my life. How did we get to the point that we're aligning ourselves with her and a white supremacist group?"</p>
		<p>I smile sympathetically behind my mask. "Come on. Let's get this over with."</p>
		<p>Without much ceremony, Bitch grows her dogs to the size of small cars and we mount them. Grue sits behind Bitch on Bastard and Shadow Stalker sits behind me on Angelica. I am uncomfortably aware of Sophia breathing down my neck. It appears that for the time being, I have been assigned the role as her handler and guardian.</p>
		<p>We make our way through the city to Purity's house. Thanks to Coil publicly doxxing them not long ago, we know that Purity–also known as Kayden Anders–lives on the fifteenth floor of an apartment building downtown. Our understanding is that ever since the dissolution of Empire Eighty-Eight following the Endbringer attack, Purity has been providing room and board for the handful of members that she trusted to be in her group.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Traveling into The Pure's territory to meet with them.<br>
		  <strong>Set a Course:</strong> (+4 supply) [7, 5 vs 5] Miss. It's safe to say that we're ambushed by someone.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> At this point in the original story The Pure had attempted to leave. Did they already take off? [31] Yeah, they're gone. So then who would be ambushing?<br>
		  <strong>Oracle Array:</strong> 1: Heroes, 2-3: Chosen, 4-6: The Nine [4] It's the Slaughterhouse Nine. Which member? (Excluding Mannequin because that'd be boring. I'm also going to rule out Cherish.)<br>
		  <strong>Oracle Array:</strong> 1: Jack Slash, 2: Bonesaw, 3: Shatterbird, 4: Burnscar, 5: The Siberian, 6: Crawler [5] Oh god. It's Siberian.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is The Pure gone because they were eliminated? [78]  No. They just skipped town like in the original.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As we approach the entrance to Purity's building, a wall above us explodes in a shower of brick and glass. The dogs quickly hop out of the way, saving us from the worst of the debris raining down upon us. It's all I do can to not be thrown from the dogs during the motion. Shadow Stalker grasps me in the process of regaining her balance as well.</p>
		<p>I send my bugs into the gaping hole in the wall to determine the cause, but it wasn't necessary. Before my bugs can even settle on the figure appearing from the cloud of dust, Grue mutters. "Siberian. Shit!"</p>
		<p>Siberian stares out into the distance of the city. Her nude body gathers a layer of dust from the cloud, graying her zebra-striped alabaster skin. Then she turns her gaze upon us.</p>
		<p>Behind me, Shadow Stalker grips my shoulders and chants under her breath "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck…"</p>
		<p>"Bitch! Retreat!" I shout and pull on Angelica's horns to spin us around. Bitch whistles, directing both Bastard and Angelica away from the building.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Heeere we go. This is going to suck.<br>
		  Since my goal is not to fight Siberian directly, I'm doing this as a scene challenge. I think we're about on equal ground.<br>
		  Scene challenge start. <em>Escape Siberian</em> (formidable).<br>
		  Set <em>Tension Clock</em> to 6 segments.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The dogs dash away from Siberian and we all hold on for dear life. Behind us, Siberian walks straight out of the hole in the wall and plummets fifteen floors. She lands at the base of the building without even bending a knee, nor leaving a cloud of dust or footprint. She had apparently extended her invincibility to the ground as she touched down.</p>
		<p>"Oh shit!" Shadow Stalker gasps, having witnessed the display of power. "She's coming! Go, go, go!"</p>
		<p>The dogs run at top speed, which is faster than the average road car, but Siberian keeps up. Not only is she fast, but she doesn't have to avoid obstacles like we do. She dashes straight through anything in her way, buildings included, as though it were made of paper.</p>
		<p>"Grue! Shadow us!" I yell.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>This is a command, so technically not shadow stat.<br>
		  <strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+2 heart) [7, 1 vs 4] Weak hit. Take +1 forward.</p>
