		<h1 id="story%20setup">Story Setup</h1>
		<p>When you begin a new story or scene, start by answering these questions to create a strong narrative backbone.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><strong>Premise:</strong> What is the initial concept and expectation of this story or scene, and what do you find engaging about it?<br>
		<em><span style="color:darkgrey">This story or scene will change as you go, so this description only covers what you think it'll be about when you start. Be honest about the reasons for wanting to use this premise, since these reasons are why you are here. It's okay if you want things that contradict what the character wants.</span></em></p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> What is the character's overarching mission, and how does the current goal and objective get them closer to accomplishing this?<br>
		<em><span style="color:darkgrey">Mission, goal, and objective can loosely be mapped to story, arc, and scene. The mission refers to what the character is trying to accomplish within this story, not just this arc or scene. The current goal is what the character is attempting to achieve right now by taking action to accomplish an objective. The current goal should logically fit within their strategy to accomplish their mission, and the current objective should logically work towards that goal.</span></em></p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p><strong>Stakes:</strong> What does the character risk in striving for their goal, and what would they risk by doing nothing? <br>
		<em><span style="color:darkgrey">It's expected that there be little to no risk for acting (low risk, high reward) when the story, arc, or scene starts, but it should increase to heights comparable to the risk of not acting (high risk, high reward) as it reaches the climax. Low stakes for not acting (low reward) are boring and deprive the character of drive.</span></em></p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> What obstacle is preventing the character from achieving their current goal or objective, and how long does the character have to overcome this?<br>
		<em><span style="color:darkgrey">The obstacle should have a real chance of preventing the characters from succeeding, not just be a nuisance. Regardless of how high the risk for not acting is, there is no tension without an impending deadline, and the tension increases exponentially as the deadline draws nearer.</span></em></p></li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h1 id="story%20tips">Story Tips</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><p>The main character must be the one with the most to lose.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>The main character must be proactive, not reactive.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>A character is driven to attain: Ability, Role, Relationship, or Status. The drive to attain this is rooted in the need for: Safety, Connection, or Empowerment. </p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>Characters are balanced by things that make them awesome and things that make them flawed. Regardless of hardship, awesomeness can only be effectively balanced against flawsâ€”an awesome character without flaws is a Mary Sue, no matter how many problems you throw at them. The character's awesomeness may overcome (ie. defeat or remove) their flaws during the story climax, but never before that.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>To make dialogue style unique for each character, consider the following scales: Verbose vs terse. Casual vs formal. Spontaneous, planned, or rehearsed.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>If a problem arises that is bigger than the story's main problem, raise the stakes of the main problem to match.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>Tension is the worry that something bad may happen. Tension is released when the worry is averted or realized. If the urgency is too low or the character's ability to succeed feels inevitable, the implied tension will feel false.</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>Scenes are about action. They can start shortly before the action (build-up/tense), during the action (in media res/exciting), or shortly after the action (mystery/intriguing).</p></li>
		</ul><ul><li><p>When crafting description, present the broad strokes first, details second.</p></li>
