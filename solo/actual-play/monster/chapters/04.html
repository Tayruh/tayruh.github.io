		<h1 id="chapter%204">Chapter 4</h1>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Cami:</strong>  Step down stress to <em>Insecure d6</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong>  Remove <em>Untrustworthy d6</em> complication. She was a good girl while unsupervised.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> I drop off the goods with Erin. [4] Interrupt Scene. [Event Focus: NPC Positive][Characters List: Melody][Actions: Support Interior] Hmm. Not sure.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Did Melody hide in my car? (Very Unlikely) Otherwise the girls suggest inviting her. [93] Exceptional no. She's still back in town and feeling ill. The girls make an argument for inviting her to the boardinghouse in the near future.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I brought my car to a stop in the large circular driveway in front of our boardinghouse. The only other vehicle parked there was our SUV, which we typically reserved for hauling around big things, like machinery, or Sera.</p>
		<p>The large and intimidating Victorian mansion loomed over us. The boardinghouse had two floors, with a partial third rising from its center, making the building far wider than it was tall. The dark gray shingles covering its roof were visible in the overcast night only by the wet surface reflecting light. The pointed arches of the roof were sharp and aggressive, and a gargoyle statue glaring down at us decorated each of its highest peaks.</p>
		<p>Or at least, I believed that they were statues. I'd never seen them move, anyway.</p>
		<p>Seoyun and I got out of the car and stretched, shaking off the long drive. I glanced over at the kumiho, and she had already let her fox ears and two large tails rematerialize. She had once told me that a significant portion of a kumiho's power is held in their tails, and keeping them absorbed while trying to pass as human expended a lot of energy. However, having all nine fluffy tails present while indoors tended to be a hazard, as I had witnessed myself, so she aimed for balance.</p>
		<p>As for the ears, Seoyun had told me, with a sly smile and a wink, that "guys love 'em," whatever that was supposed to mean.</p>
		<p>I popped the rear hatch of the car and grabbed two bags of supplies, then stepped back to make room for Seoyun to do the same. She only managed one bag, not being blessed with supernatural strength, nor much in the way of muscles. Not in this particular human form, anyway.</p>
		<p>Finola seated herself atop my head and held strands of my hair in her tiny hands like they were horse reins. Now that we were home, the little faerie was free to scamper off to wherever she liked, but clinging to me like this was the norm for her and I didn't mind it.</p>
		<p>I felt a tug on my hair and the heel of a teeny foot bop me on the head. "Hyaa! Giddy up, little horsey!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is it Seoyun who suggests that Melody join us? (50/50) Otherwise it's Finola. [81] No. Finola suggests it.</p>
