# Rules

## Rolling

### Oracle Move
- When you *ask a meta question about the world, people, or events,* frame it as a “yes” or ”no” question, with a “yes” representing the most favorable (or simplest) outcome. Roll two dice, noting the order.
- **10+** Yes, or true. If the first die is higher than the second, there’s a positive twist in your favor, an “and” qualifier. You may choose to discard the “and” or a flawed assumption, if there is one.
- **7-9** Yes, or true, but complicated in some way. Roll or choose a Dramatic Move or a Motif if you need inspiration, but remember, this complication does not need to be an immediate, direct threat to you, if the fiction, or the question, doesn’t warrant it.
- **6-** No, or false. If the first die is higher than the second, intensify the answer or circumstances (an “and”), using a Move or Motif as if for a 7-9 result.
- If the dice match, there’s a flaw in the basic assumptions you made while framing the question that makes the answer irrelevant. Incorporate this information as part of your narration as you would a yes or no answer’s result. You may instead choose to make a Dramatic Move that results from the flawed assumption, including the truth as an in-fiction reveal or detailing how your hero made a mistake in your narration. If you do, take a dark die. 
- Note: you may adjust the modifier up or down between -3 (very unlikely) and +3 (very likely), but do this sparingly; it’s much more important to get the result and continue than to model the odds perfectly.
- You may also spend a light die to flat-out declare the answer to an Oracle question after you roll it, if the fiction represented by that die justifies it and you account for it in the fiction as usual. 

### Strive Move
- When you *act with purpose but your dramatic instincts say success shouldn’t be free*, define what you want to achieve and a danger you find interesting.
- **10+** You succeed, as intended, and avoid the danger entirely. Choose a bonus: gain one light die, remove (or adjust) one of your Conditions, or reduce another Condition by 1 rank.
- **7-9** Either you succeed or you avert the danger, your choice. You may opt to choose neither and instead choose a bonus from the 10+ result. If you deliver on a danger, play a soft Move or follow through on a previous soft Move with a hard Move.
- **6-** You fail, and the danger hits, as a hard Move followed through to the full extent. Add or increase a Condition, then take a dark die, after. If you’re striving against a foe or obstacle, also add a Condition to them that makes it harder to overcome them in that way. 
- You may add a modifier to your roll consisting of the sum of applicable Tags under a single Trait, up to a modifier of +4. When you narrate the outcome, include this Trait and Tags.

**Reserve Die and Hindering Aspects**
+ You may choose to add one or more light and/or dark dice to the roll; keep only the two highest of all dice (“roll with advantage”). To roll a light die, narrate how you’re leveraging the fiction it represents in a helpful or useful way. To roll a dark die, narrate how you’ve learned something from an earlier failure. You may always change your action if you narrate instead how the goal is temporarily unobtainable.
+ If one of your Traits or other character aspects is an obvious drawback in a situation that calls for a roll, roll a light die for that aspect and keep only the lowest two dice (“roll with disadvantage”). If the two kept dice include the aspect’s die or if you fail the roll because of it, include in your narration how that aspect causes you trouble. 
+ Reserve dice and hindrance dice cancel each other out 1 for 1. If there are remaining reserve dice, roll for advantage; if there are remaining hindrance dice, roll for disadvantage.

### Conditions & Trauma
- You have six Condition slots for conditions that impact you at the moment and three Trauma slots.
- If a Condition or Trauma affects a Strive roll, include how in your roll narration. If it is rank 2 and makes a Strive roll more difficult, also roll with disadvantage. If it is rank 3 and makes a Strive roll more difficult, you can only strive (with disadvantage) in that way by choosing one:
	- spend a reserve die and narrate how the fiction it represents (light) or experience (dark) helps you cope.
	- narrate how the Condition causes great suffering or impels someone to act; deliver an extra danger on any outcome.
- When you make a Strive roll affected by a Trauma and earn a bonus, you may pick “confront the Trauma” as your bonus. When you do, move it into a Condition slot at the same rank, either as-is or modified to something like *shaken*, *dazed* or *euphoric*.
- You may choose at any time to compensate for a Trauma, reducing its rank by 1 (but never below 1) by rolling or choosing a Break, narrating a hard Dramatic Move, rolled at random, along with any fallout, and gaining a suitable new rank-1 Condition.

+ Example Conditions: tired, in love, angry, hungry, lost, haunted, stressed
+ Example Traumas: bitterness, unrequited love, racked with guilt, arrogance, paranoia, foolish optimism

### Clock
- Set a d6 in front of you, with “6” facing up. If any die kept on a Strive roll matches this clock, roll a motif, narrate an event inspired by it, and play a soft Dramatic Move. Reduce the clock by 1. At 0, make a hard Dramatic Move, then reset the clock.
- Every Scenario has a special “match” and “time’s up” for the clock; use these to add tension.

### Reserve Die
- Light dice, often earned on a success, represent part of the fiction, usually fiction in your favor. When you gain one, give it a name referring to that fiction, like “the high ground in this fight” or “influence over the Spider”. Light dice are situational; they are discarded when the situation changes enough that the fiction they represent is no longer relevant.
- Dark dice, usually earned on a failure, represent general life experience. Dark dice are persistent, lasting until you roll them or spend them for advancements. 
- A reserve die may also be recharging or perpetual. These dice are returned to your pool after they are used instead of being discarded, as long as the conditions to do so are met.

## Resolution
### Hard & Soft Moves
- Using a move to establish a threat that will result in a Condition or calamity unless the protagonist acts is called a “soft” Move, and serves to telegraph the danger of a situation.
- Playing a Move through the full logical consequences, usually until a Condition is inflicted, without a chance for the protagonist to act, is called a “hard” Move, and often involves delivering on an earlier soft Move’s telegraphed danger.
- Use soft moves, combined with random events and motifs, frequently, when you’re unsure what should happen next, when framing a scene, or when using an Oracle. Use hard moves when a danger strikes on a miss, when a danger is not averted and has previously been telegraphed with a soft move, and whenever you feel it is fictionally appropriate.

### Motif Chart
- The Motif chart is a d66 chart (six rows, six columns, each labeled from 1 to 6 and with, optionally, NPC, PC, Event, General, Main Plot, and Subplot).
- When a bit of fiction strikes you as a question important to answer, as an image to explore further, or as a potentially satisfying call-back, add it to the Motif chart in the next available spot.
- Frame scenes by rolling three times on this chart or on any motif chart and combining those elements, literally, figuratively, or inspired by, into the scene frame. If you are using labels, you may choose the result of the first d6.
- Look to your Motif Chart first when adding color to your Dramatic Moves, dangers, and actors, and when bringing in earlier plot threads. If a roll lands on an empty cell, use the results on a motif chart of your choice instead.
- When you’ve filled your motif table entirely (aim to do this after ten to twelve scenes), wrap the game up. Choose three or more motifs to carry over into your next game, and take a persistent light die for up to three for your next adventure. You also gain the Edge “Renown” or a new achievement for it.

+ **Renown \[Edge\]:** Name a notable deed or achievement when you take this Edge. When you begin a new Motif chart, you may choose to add a motif related to this deed. When you use this motif, take a light die that represents the deed, its consequences or impact on the world, or your reputation in context of it.
## Characters
### Creation
- Choose four Traits, with ten Tags between them, two Keys, and two Edges. 
- You start with two rank-1 or one rank-2 Conditions, and a rank-1 Trauma. You face an immediate Danger.

### Traits
- **\[Forte\]:** [Asset], [Specialty], Experience, Gift For It, Reputation
- **\[Gift\]:** [Positive Benefit], Duration, Power, [Drawback]
- **\[Background\]:** [Training], [Education], As Expected of Me, Conform, Unexpectedly, Rebel
- **In Shape:** Dodge, Reflexes, Athletic, Sprint, Endurance, [Specialty], [Sport]
- **Tough:** Endure, Iron Will, Emotional Intelligence, High Pain Threshold, Assess Danger
- **Resourceful:** Perceptive, Prepared, Seize Opportunity, Lucky, [Resource]

### Simple Traits
- I am gifted with a [skill or talent], but I am terrible at [skill].
- I am [background], taught [thing] but fascinated by [other thing].
- My [talent] is surpassed only by my [narrow subset of that talent].
- I am [thing] and [thing], and thus [logical consequence of both].
- My [gift] and [talent] bolster my [skill] as long as I [requirement].
- I am [heritage], but I am [way I am different from the others].

### Keys & Advancement
- **The Key of the Ethics:** Hit this key when you act in accordance with your ethics and it costs you a little. Change: act unethically, by your lights.
- **The Key of the Curious:** Hit this key when you dig into something that isn’t your business. Change: let an enigma or oddity go unquestioned.

+ Keys have two parts; a note to hit, and a way to change. When the character hits their key, usually by doing a thing that’s relatively easy but invites a little trouble or drama into their life, take a dark die. When you invoke the “Change” clause, take one light die representing the momentum of the change and two dark dice, and lose the Key. You may choose a new one.
+ You add new aspects to your character sheet by saving and spending dark dice. Buy new Edges for three dice, Traits for two dice, and Tags for one die, as long as the narrative, and the character’s experiences, supports the purchase. If the narrative demands the loss of something you would have to spend dice to replace, lose it; gain a light die that represents the loss and take a dark die. 
+ Keys are always in the same format; a thing you do, or method or goal you pursue, and a way to contravene that thing and change. They should be narrow and specific, and encourage the kinds of actions you want to see in play.

### Edges
- **Praxi:** Add or choose a rank-1 Condition that defines your usual approach to problems, like fierceness, caution, or stealth. As long as you have it, you always have light dice equal to its rank representing this approach.
- **Protagonist:** When you hit a Key, take a light die for the “main character” qualities implied by that Key. If you keep this die (count it as part of a roll result), gain a rank-1 Condition or increase an existing Condition by 1

+ In general, an Edge will grant a light die under specific circumstances, in exchange for a fictionally appropriate Condition. Because Edges rewrite the game’s rules, always impose a cost or consequence for using them. Example:
	- **Lucky \[Edge\]:** You’re lucky, but you always seem to need to be. You can choose to roll a “lucky” light die on any roll, but if you count that die as part of the result, gain a rank-2 Condition like *unconscious*, *smitten* or *blind* after the roll is resolved.

### Down for the Count
- When you gain a sixth Condition (excluding Traumas), narrate a hard Dramatic Move showing how things get irrevocably worse, then end the scene and frame a new one, if you survive.
- Clear at least one Condition that circumstances negate. Worsen an existing Trauma by one step or add a new one.

### Losing It
- When a character fills all of their Trauma slots with rank-3 Traumas, they lose control, become sloppy, or otherwise act out. Roll or choose how this manifests, then narrate what events unfold because of this as a series of two or more hard Dramatic Moves.
- Remove two ranks split between one or more Traumas, and then frame a scene in the immediate aftermath of the character’s loss of self-control.

## External Factors

### Gear, Vehicles, & Armor
- Generally, assume that your character has all the equipment they could be expected to be carrying, given who they are and their circumstances.
- For items that are meaningful to your protagonist, you may opt to purchase a Trait to reflect their nature (like “[Weapon]” as “My Father’s Sword” or “[Vehicle]” as “The Flying Vixen”). These items are called Gear. 
- Gear, as a Trait, influences the fiction, and something about the reality of the world, about what is possible, and about what matters to the character. It can only be used to modify a roll if the item in question is in a position to be relevant. And, like all Traits, Gear can be lost, altered, broken, or stolen as part of events and Moves.
- When you would otherwise take a Condition, if you can narrate how your Gear reduced or averted the condition, you may instead mark off a Tag from that Trait. Marked Tags are no longer usable to build modifiers; you don’t necessarily lose the item or the ability, but its impact on future events is reduced.
- Restore one or more marked Tags when you narrate how you takes the time to repair, clean, or otherwise fix the item up, or when it is fictionally appropriate.

### Actors & Relationships
- Actors do not roll.
- You may always choose to give your character a Condition or Trauma like *wildly in love (3)*, *like a child to me (2)*, *frustrating rival (3)*, or *happily married (3)* that represents their feelings towards an actor; give the actor one rank of Conditions for every rank in this Condition. 
- When the relationship represented by a Condition could help you in a safe, purely mental or emotional, or indirect way, you may choose to reduce that Condition by one rank and take a light die representing the actor’s help, training, or words of wisdom.
- If an actor is in a position to help you in a major, immediate, or direct way, and is also exposed to risk, you may instead choose to add a relationship bonus, up to the value of any one of your relationship Conditions with that actor, to your modifier.
- All outcomes of a roll boosted by a relationship bonus are gained or suffered equally by all parties contributing to it. Choose any options as necessary, individually, as if each actor were your character. Additionally, any actors providing this assistance gain a Condition like *feels used*, *broken arm*, or *unconscious* of the same rank as the boost.
- When a Dramatic Move or other roll indicates an NPC is in harm’s way or jeopardized, and no obvious target presents, look at your highest relationship Conditions first.

### Obstacles & Enemies

- Obstacles can usually be removed as a significant threat with a single Strive roll, as long as it is consistent with the established fiction.
- An obstacle’s Conditions affect interactions with it and need to be removed through Strive bonuses before the danger can truly be defeated in that way. They affect the fiction, and affect your rolls as if they were your own.
- Assigning one often occurs on a low roll or a Move, but don’t be afraid to also create Conditions on the fly, either as your instincts direct or the Oracle does.

## The 3-Act Frame

### Scene Framing
- When rolling a Dramatic Move, roll a d6 first, and on a 1-2, use Dramatic Moves A, 2-4, Dramatic Moves B, and 5-6, the Act Moves.
- For each scene, roll the scene Type, Focus, and Frame, along with a Motif from a table of your choosing, interpreted as usual.
- Each scene has questions to answer and a central event, rolled on an event table. Once per scene, choose a roll related to this central event as the scene’s core challenge. Declare it before you roll and add “take a Score die” to the bonuses you can choose from on a 10+ or bargain for on 7-9 for this roll. On a 6-, instead roll up a new formidable condition for the Enemy. End the scene at any time after the Core Challenge has occurred.

### Act 1

- Use Dramatic Moves to create the central events for this segment.
- Show us: What’s the status quo? How do you suffer under it? How do you struggle against it, if you do, or cope with it, if you don’t? Who else suffers with you? Who suffers if you rebel?
- Frame and play a Catalyst scene that jolts you out of the status quo. In the next scene, declare the Lock-in Goal, then make a Dramatic Move framed as an immediate problem as the central event. Your goal, at least in the short-term, is clear. 
- Answer in play: what is it?

+ **ACT 1 MOVES**

- Show us: why can’t you win right now? What is the biggest threat?
- Frame a scene that contains the Midpoint. Whether it’s a triumph or not, you have a new problem in the next scene; bring in a subplot. Compare and contrast this Subplot with existing motifs.
