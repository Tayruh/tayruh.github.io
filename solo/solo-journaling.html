		<p>This document outlines the main procedures that I follow while journaling my solo games. The purpose of this document is to get this down on paper for myself, and to possibly provide insight for others. It is not intended to declare "this is how journaling should be done," only that this is how I prefer to do it. Your mileage may vary.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
		<p><strong>Player Role:</strong> Determine actions for PC and describe them.</p>
		<p><strong>GM Role:</strong> Determine setting lore. Describe the world. Determine or roll for NPC actions and describe them. Determine actions for GMPCs and describe them.</p>
		<p>Since describing anything outside of the PC is the role of the GM, I believe that when one intends to assume the role of the Player in solo, they are actually assuming the role of the GM controlling a GMPC, even when using oracles to aid in answering questions of the world and NPCs. This guide is presented under assumption that this is the case.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2>
		<p><strong>First Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best with a single PC as a GMPC. Could work as an NPC, as long as they're referred to in third person for questions (eg. "Does Frodo look for traps?").<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• World is described in an opinionated manner by the character, not the GM.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Allows for internal character dialogue.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best in past tense, since it's like you're retelling a story.</p>
		<p><strong>Second Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Only works with a single PC as an NPC, but it's still kind of strange because the "you" would be speaking to the dice, not a real player.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best in present tense, since its purpose is to put you (or rather, the fictional player) in the moment.</p>
		<p><strong>Third Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works well with any number of PCs as NPCs and/or GMPCs.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Close third person</em> is described by the GM but the narration is heavily influenced by the opinions of the character, even so far as directly injecting their thoughts into the narration. Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Limited Distant third person</em> is described by the GM following a single character, restricting information to what they can perceive. Unlike Close third person, the character does not influence the narrative, and any internal dialogue is done as thoughts quoted in italics  (eg. "<em>Dammit</em>, he thought.").<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Omniscient Distant third person</em> is like Limited Distant third person, except that it follows more than one character and allows for relaying information beyond what any characters can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Can work in past or present tense—past follows typical fiction, but present is probably more immersive.</p>
		<p>First person is the ideal perspective when a single character's thoughts and opinions would enhance the narrative. Limited Distant third person is ideal for parties without a main character. Third person perspective in general has many options for narrating and works well in any situation. Second person perspective doesn't work well in roleplaying without a live player. </p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="narration">Narration</h2>
		<p><strong>Large-Scale Structure</strong> (Scene &amp; Sequel)</p>
		<p>Scene: Goal &gt; Conflict &gt; Disaster<br>
		Sequel: Reaction &gt; Dilemma &gt; Decision</p>
		<p>Scenes actually come in two forms of structure: what we typically consider a Scene, and its complementary, the Sequel. A <em>Scene</em> is action, where the character works towards a goal. A <em>Sequel</em> is problem solving, where the character determines the correct path forward. Where Scenes are about fixing a problem, Sequels are about analyzing the problem. The two generally alternate, with a Scene leading directly into a Sequel, and a Sequel leading into a Scene. They can double or triple up when necessary, but it should be a rarity.</p>
		<p>A <em>Scene</em> begins with a character Goal, which they have to overcome Conflict to achieve, and then ends with a Disaster. The Conflict refers to any and all things blocking their Goal in this scene. The Disaster is a new problem that the character needs solve, whether they achieved their Goal or not.</p>
		<p>A <em>Sequel</em> begins with the character's instinctive reaction to the Disaster of the previous Scene, then they contemplate their current Dilemma, and then they make a Decision on how to proceed. Contemplating the Dilemma usually takes the form of character dialogue, introspection, or connecting clues. The Decision made determines the Goal of the next Scene.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Small-Scale Structure</strong> (Motivation-Reaction Units)</p>
		<p>Reaction: Feeling &gt; Reflex &gt; Rational Action and Speech</p>
		<p>Scenes and Sequels are divided up into Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs), which are just repeating blocks of world actions followed by character reactions. This is given structure because the narration provides a better experience when it follows a specific pattern.</p>
		<p>In this structure, the world first does something that prompts a response from the character, giving them Motivation to react. Starting with the following paragraph, the narration then describes the immediate sensations and emotions that the character is Feeling, followed by their instinctive Reflex. This all happens in instant, as reactions do. Once the knee-jerk reaction has passed, the character spends time contemplating the correct response, and then executes a Rational Action, possibly followed by Speech. Once the character has finished reacting, the narration describes their effect on the world starting with the next paragraph, restarting the MRU cycle.</p>
		<p>The <em>Motivation</em> is external and objective. Motivation happens within a single paragraph, presented as it would be shown by a video camera. In roleplaying, this where the GM describes the setting and an event, ending with a prompt for the player to react to.</p>
		<p>The Motivation can be complex or it can be simple. The only requirement is that it be external and objective, something that not only the character can see and hear and feel but which any other observer could also see and hear and feel, if they were there. It's okay if Motivation happens in a sequence of paragraphs, but it's very important that the emotions and unique senses of the character are not present in the Motivation, as mixing them is just as disorienting as switching perspectives in a scene.</p>
		<p>The <em>Reaction</em> is internal and subjective. Reaction happens in the paragraph(s) following the Motivation, presented exactly as your character would experience it. In roleplaying, this is where the player describes how their character reacts to an event, then declares what they intend to do about it.</p>
		<p>The Reaction is more complex than the Motivation. The reason is that it is internal, and internal processes happen on different time-scales. You must present the full complex of your character’s reactions in this order, from fastest time-scale to slowest. It's okay to skip steps in a Reaction, but the remaining steps must still go in order and increase in time-scale.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger dropped out of the tree and sprang toward Jack.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bolt of raw adrenaline shot through Jack’s veins. He jerked his rifle to his shoulder, sighted on the tiger’s heart, and squeezed the trigger. “Die, you bastard!”<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullet grazed the tiger’s left shoulder. Blood squirted out of the jagged wound. The tiger roared and staggered, then leaped in the air straight at Jack’s throat.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The tiger dropped out of the tree and sprang toward Jack. <em>The motivation is described objectively without influence of the character's senses or emotions.</em><br>
		  <strong>Feeling:</strong> A bolt of raw adrenaline shot through Jack’s veins. <em>You show this first, because it happens almost instantly. We are now back in the character's head, describing events subjectively.</em><br>
		  <strong>Reflex:</strong> He jerked his rifle to his shoulder . . . <em>You show this second, as a result of the fear. An instinctive result that requires no conscious thought.</em><br>
		  <strong>Rational Action and Speech:</strong> . . . sighted on the tiger’s heart, and squeezed the trigger. "Die, you bastard!” <em>You put this last, when Jack has had time to think and act in a rational way. He pulls the trigger, a rational response to the danger. He speaks, a rational expression of his intense emotional reaction.</em></p>
		  <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The bullet grazed the tiger’s left shoulder. Blood squirted out of the jagged wound. The tiger roared and staggered, then leaped in the air straight at Jack’s throat. <em>This begins the next Motivation-Reaction Unit.</em></p>

		<br>
		<h2 id="style%20guide">Style Guide</h2>
		<p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>
		<p>Oracle questions, skill check intents, and roll interpretations are given in present tense regardless of perspective (eg. "Does the guard let me pass?").</p>
		<p>Character sheet changes are given using the imperative (eg. "Mark progress and add Bob as a connection").</p>
		<p>Adjustments to a roll are given in simple past tense (eg. "Swarm SFX added d6 to pool and stepped up effect").</p>
		<p>Labels are always in bold.</p>
		<p>References to temporary items on character sheets (threads, aspects, vows, complications, etc) are in italics.</p>
		<p>Numerical adjustments to character sheets should give the new value in parenthesis.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
		<p>Since all oracle questions, skill checks, and character sheet changes come with labels, anything placed on a line without a label is a note to the reader.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm going to set this meeting up as a scene challenge.<br>
		  <strong>Begin the Scene:</strong> Add <em>Convince the Heroes</em> (formidable) as scene objective. Set <em>Tension Clock</em> to 6 segments.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm going to set this meeting up as a scene challenge.<br>
		  <strong>Change:</strong> Begin the Scene: Add Convince the Heroes (formidable) as scene objective. Set Tension Clock to 6 segments.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Binary Questions</strong></p>
		<p>The label can list the type of binary question it is (eg. "Fate Chart"), or simply be labeled as "Oracle."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is the coroner making a phone call? (50/50) Otherwise she steals something. [3] Exceptional yes. It's more than just a business call.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Fate Chart<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Is the coroner making a phone call?<br>
		  <strong>Likelihood:</strong> (50/50)<br>
		  <strong>Alternative:</strong> Otherwise she steals something.<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [3]<br>
		  <strong>Result:</strong> Exceptional yes.<br>
		  <strong>Interpretation:</strong> It's more than just a business call.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Open Questions</strong></p>
		<p>The label can list the exact table that is being rolled on (eg. "Character Action"), be listed as "Meaning" to indicate that it's an open question, or simply be labeled as "Oracle" to lump it with binary questions.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Where are we? [Dark / Cramped] In the basement.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Meaning<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Where are we?<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [Dark / Cramped]<br>
		  <strong>Interpretation:</strong> In the basement.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Oracle Arrays</strong></p>
		<p>These are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Oracle Array:</strong> Where does the meeting with the heroes take place? (1-2: Protectorate HQ, 3-4: The train yard, 5-6: Downtown) [6] It takes place Downtown.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Oracle Array<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Where does the meeting with the heroes take place?<br>
		  <strong>Array:</strong> (1-2: Protectorate HQ, 3-4: The train yard, 5-6: Downtown)<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [6]<br>
		  <strong>Result:</strong> It takes place Downtown.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Skill Checks</strong></p>
		<p>Skill checks usually list the acting character for the label, but PbtA games may use the move name instead. Slight adjustments to display of modifiers/dice pool and rolls may be needed for clarity depending on rule system. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Skitter:</strong> I try to summon my swarm. (Bug Controller d8, Devotion d8, Intellect d8, Bug Control d8, d6) [1, 7, 1, 2, 5] = 12 (d10). Swarm SFX added d6 to pool and stepped up effect. Success. Create <em>Bug Decoys</em> d10 asset. Take <em>Afraid</em> d8 stress and +1 PP (2) from hitches. I summon decoys from my swarm but the enemy chases after my subordinate.</p>
		  <hr>
