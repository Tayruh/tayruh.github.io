		<blockquote>
		  <p>I decided to not do the Set a Course move since I think being accompanied by Shadow Stalker would minimize the danger.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The walk to Grue's base is uneventful. Shadow Stalker and I keep our distance and don't say a word. She trails just a bit behind me as I lead the way, which leaves me with an itch between my shoulder blades. She may have become an apparent team member as of an hour ago, but I'd be an idiot to trust her at my back. Regardless, the bugs I have hidden on her body relay her every motion to me so I'm in no real danger, but the feeling remains.</p>
		<p>I sense Grue and Bitch with my bugs before I see them. They're both standing outside the entrance to his base. Bitch has two of her dogs with her. Angelica and Bastard, maybe? They're currently in their normal forms and collapsed happily at her feet.</p>
		<p>As we approach my teammates, Grue crosses his arms and fixes his gaze on Shadow Stalker. Bitch bristles beside him.</p>
		<p>"Hey, guys," I venture. "Tattletale tell you what's going on?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Grue has beef with Shadow Stalker but how is he handling this?<br>
		  <strong>Initial Disposition:</strong> [Threatening] Yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Yeah, I heard," Grue growls. "Shadow Stalker wants to join our team. And you two are okay with this?"</p>
		<p>Angelica growls, sensing Grue's tension. Bitch strokes the scruff on her neck and she calms.</p>
		<p>"Desperate times." I shrug. "Trust me, I have the strongest reasons for not wanting her on the team, or even in the same city, but I'm willing to put that aside to take out the Nine."</p>
		<p>Grue appears to glower at me behind his skull mask. "She shot me with a fucking arrow."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker snorts. I just shake my head. "That doesn't even compare to what she's done to me." </p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker smirks. That bitch.</p>
		<p>Grue holds up a hand. "Hold on. You have history with her? Why haven't I heard about this?"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to get into it," I say firmly, shutting down that avenue of the conversation. "Are we okay here? We need her."</p>
		<p>Grue ponders the situation. He turns to Bitch who is squatting by her dogs and petting them. She catches him looking. "Don't ask me. I don't fucking care. Do what you want," she says.</p>
		<p>Grue huffs out a breath then points a finger at Shadow Stalker. "This is a trial period. You fuck us and we end you."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker laughs. "Yeah, okay. Just try it, fuckhead."</p>
		<p>"Guys, enough," I say, interrupting their childish posturing. "We'll have to run it by Coil after this mission anyway, so nothing is set in stone. Though I don't see why he'd turn down manpower."</p>
		<p>"He's not going to give her territory." Grue resumes crossing his arms grumpily.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. She's… Oh god..," I say as the realization hits me. Of course he wouldn't give her territory. The city is already evenly divided between us Undersiders and The Travelers. Any new members would have to be assigned to already existing territory, like how Grue shares with Imp. I bury my face in hands.  "I'm probably going to have to put her up."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker bursts out laughing. It's not a kind laugh. "I'm going to be rooming with Taylor? That's amazing!" She laughs some more.</p>
		<p>I peer out from my hands at her. "Just remember that I have hundreds of black widow spiders just a room away from where you'll be sleeping."</p>
		<p>Her laughter quiets quickly and she seems to once again be rethinking her enrollment.</p>
		<p>"She called you Taylor," Grue notes with suspicion. When I don't respond, he pieces together what I was alluding to earlier. He takes an angry step forward. "Is Shadow Stalker one of your bullies?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well…" I lower my gaze and clench my fists. "That doesn't matter right now."</p>
		<p>"This is fucked, Skitter." Grue paces. "And Tattletale agreed to this?" </p>
		<p>"You know her. She's willing to do something distasteful as long as it furthers her goal."</p>
		<p>Grue huffs. "Ain't that the truth."</p>
		<p>"Enough talk," Bitch grumbles. "If we're not doing anything, I'm going back to take care of my dogs."</p>
		<p>I nod. "I agree with Bitch. This matter has been settled and there's no point dwelling on it. Priority is trying to recruit The Pure against the Nine."</p>
		<p>"That's even worse than Shadow Stalker!" Grue groans in frustration. "Fuck my life. How did we get to the point that we're aligning ourselves with her and a white supremacist group?"</p>
		<p>I smile sympathetically behind my mask. "Come on. Let's get this over with."</p>
		<p>Without much ceremony, Bitch grows her dogs to the size of small cars and we mount them. Grue sits behind Bitch on Bastard and Shadow Stalker sits behind me on Angelica. I am uncomfortably aware of Sophia breathing down my neck. It appears that for the time being, I have been assigned the role as her handler and guardian.</p>
		<p>We make our way through the city to Purity's house. Thanks to Coil publicly doxxing them not long ago, we know that Purity—also known as Kayden Anders—lives on the fifteenth floor of an apartment building downtown. Our understanding is that ever since the dissolution of Empire Eighty-Eight following the Endbringer attack, Purity has been providing room and board for the handful of members that she trusted to be in her group.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Traveling into The Pure's territory to meet with them.<br>
		  <strong>Set a Course:</strong> (+4 supply) [7, 5 vs 5] Miss. It's safe to say that we're ambushed by someone.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> At this point in the original story The Pure had attempted to leave. Did they already take off? [31] Yeah, they're gone. So then who would be ambushing?<br>
		  <strong>Oracle Array:</strong> 1: Heroes, 2-3: Chosen, 4-6: The Nine [4] It's the Slaughterhouse Nine. Which member? (Excluding Mannequin because that'd be boring. I'm also going to rule out Cherish.)<br>
		  <strong>Oracle Array:</strong> 1: Jack Slash, 2: Bonesaw, 3: Shatterbird, 4: Burnscar, 5: The Siberian, 6: Crawler [5] Oh god. It's Siberian.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is The Pure gone because they were eliminated? [78]  No. They just skipped town like in the original.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As we approach the entrance to Purity's building, a wall above us explodes in a shower of brick and glass. The dogs quickly hop out of the way, saving us from the worst of the debris raining down upon us. It's all I do can to not be thrown from the dogs during the motion. Shadow Stalker grasps me in the process of regaining her balance as well.</p>
		<p>I send my bugs into the gaping hole in the wall to determine the cause, but it wasn't necessary. Before my bugs can even settle on the figure appearing from the cloud of dust, Grue mutters, "Siberian. Shit!"</p>
		<p>Siberian stares out into the distance of the city. Her nude body gathers a layer of dust from the cloud, graying her zebra-striped alabaster skin. Then she turns her gaze upon us.</p>
		<p>Behind me, Shadow Stalker grips my shoulders and chants under her breath, "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck…"</p>
		<p>"Bitch! Retreat!" I shout and pull on Angelica's horns to spin us around. Bitch whistles, directing both Bastard and Angelica away from the building.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Heeere we go. This is going to suck.<br>
		  Since my goal is not to fight Siberian directly, I'm doing this as a scene challenge. I think we're about on equal ground.<br>
		  <strong>Begin the Scene:</strong> Add <em>Escape Siberian</em> (formidable) as scene objective. Set <em>Tension Clock</em> to 6 segments.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The dogs dash away from Siberian and we all hold on for dear life. Behind us, Siberian walks straight out of the hole in the wall and plummets fifteen floors. She lands at the base of the building without even bending a knee, nor leaving a cloud of dust or footprint. She had apparently extended her invincibility to the ground as she touched down.</p>
		<p>"Oh shit!" Shadow Stalker gasps, having witnessed the display of power. "She's coming! Go, go, go!"</p>
		<p>The dogs run at top speed, which is faster than the average road car, but Siberian keeps up. Not only is she fast, but she doesn't have to avoid obstacles like we do. She dashes straight through anything in her way, buildings included, as though it were made of paper.</p>
		<p>"Grue! Shadow us!" I yell.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>This is a command, so technically not shadow stat.<br>
		  <strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+2 heart) [7, 1 vs 4] Weak hit. Take +1 forward. The darkness blinds her but doesn't slow her down.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Grue releases a cloud of darkness from beneath his costume that trails behind him. He is ahead of us so we are also enveloped in his darkness. I feel Shadow Stalker tighten her grip, but it's fine; I don't need my eyes to see where we're going.</p>
		<p>Unlike us, Siberian is running blind. This fact seems to have little bearing on her speed though. Grue's cloud often dampens powers, but it appears to have no effect on Siberian. She doesn't even have to slow down because she can just plow through anything in her path like it isn't even there.</p>
		<p>Taking advantage of the fact that Siberian is both blind and deaf at the moment, I shout, "Grue, go right!" Bitch can't hear me, but I feel Grue signal her. Bastard veers to the right at the next intersection and takes off down an open street.</p>
		<p>I pull Angelica to the left and we dash down the road opposite Grue.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Attempting to lose Siberian in the darkness.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+1 shadow, +1 forward) [4, 1 vs 7] Strong hit. Mark progress (1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I sense Siberian burst through the darkness to find herself running alone down the street. She stops and listens.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is Grue using darkness on himself? (Likely) [87] No. He's keeping the path clear for Bitch.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Siberian go after me? [57] No. She goes after Grue instead.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Without hesitation Siberian runs straight through the building to her right. The building buckles under her assault, and as she exits it to enter the same street as Grue, the building folds in on itself like a house of cards. She leaves the crumbling building in her wake and sprints down the street after Grue.</p>
		<p>"Shit!" I curse. I was hoping to draw her away from the others. I pull back on Angelica, instructing her to stop.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing?" Shadow Stalker asks frantically. "Let's go!"</p>
		<p>"We can't leave them," I scold her. I turn Angelica around and push her toward the direction of the chase.</p>
		<p>"Are you insane! What can we possibly do to help?" Sophia is losing her shit.</p>
		<p>I look at her over my shoulder and snap, "If you don't have the stomach for this, you can get off right here."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Checking to see if she's going to bail on us.<br>
		  <strong>Test Your Relationship:</strong> (+2 heart) [1, 9 vs 5] Weak hit. Mark progress on <em>Shadow Stalker</em> connection (2). Her pride is injured and so she strikes back.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Fuck you, Taylor," she fires back. "You think you're better than me?"</p>
		<p>"I <em>am</em> better than you, Sophia. You only fight when there is no risk to yourself."</p>
		<p>"I fought a damn Endbringer!" she contests.</p>
		<p>I scoff. "With your crossbow. From the shadows. And no risk to yourself."</p>
		<p>Unable to deny the accusation but still needing the last word, Shadow Stalker replies with only a feeble "… fuck you." She remains quiet as we bound up the street toward Siberian.</p>
		<p>Further up the street I can feel the invincible woman with my bugs. I send large swarms in her direction and form them into clones of myself in the hope of distracting her.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+1 shadow, +2 bug health) [10, 7 vs 5] Miss. Fill clock segment (1). I fail but I'm not sure what effect a failed distraction would have.<br>
		  <strong>Pay the Price:</strong> [You are stressed] She comes after us.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The distraction proves to be a bit more effective than I intended. Upon spotting the swarm clones, the Siberian abandons her quarry and spins on her heel. She defies physics by redirecting her forward momentum and sprinting towards us without losing speed, as though she pinballed off an invisible wall.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker gasps and clenches onto my shoulders. I pull Angelica in the direction of the nearest building, calling, "Up!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Commanding Angelica to climb.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 heart) [5, 6 vs 8] Strong hit. Mark progress (2). We momentarily escape Siberian.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Angelica digs her large claws into the side of the building and climbs. Shadow Stalker and I hang on the best we can as we vertically scale the building like a bear climbing a tree. Shadow Stalker is bounced around behind me, and just when I thought she might fall, we breach the roof of the building and land on flat ground.</p>
		<p>"Go, Angelica!" I shout, spurring her on. She sprints across the rooftop, and when we reach the ledge, she leaps like a cat. I hold my breath as we go airborne. We hang in the air for what feels like an eternity before landing squarely on the roof of the next building. Angelica doesn't miss a step and continues running at full tilt.</p>
		<p>The building shakes beneath us. Angelica dashes across the rooftop and leaps to the next. As we leave the building behind us, it begins to topple. There is a series of crashes below us and this building destabilizes as well. Angelica nearly loses her footing but regains it just in time to leap to the next building. As we soar across the gap, I catch a glimpse of Siberian. Rather than attempting to follow us to the roof, she had decided to take a direct route through the buildings. She appears to be taking out the structural supports as she follows us. The first building has collapsed against the second, creating a domino effect of toppling buildings that are effectively chasing us.</p>
		<p>"Ohhh shit!" Shadow Stalker gasps as Angelica skids to a halt at edge of the building. We have reached the end of the city block and there is no place left for the dog to jump to.</p>
		<p>The building behind us crashes into ours and the rooftop begins tilting at an angle. Angelica attempts backpedaling away from the edge of the roof but the angle of the rooftop pushes her forward. I hang onto Angelica for all I'm worth as she digs her claws deep into the rooftop and rides out the descent of the building.</p>
		<p>When the top of the building becomes more vertical than it is horizontal, I shout, "Angelica, jump!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Command Angelica to leap from the building.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 heart) [2, 8 vs 8] Weak hit. Mark progress (3) and fill clock segment (2). We make it, but not safely.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Angelica leaps backward off the rooftop to the street below. She doesn't land solidly and we are thrown from her; to our benefit since we avoid being crushed by her weight or skewered by her bone spikes as she rolls across the pavement. Shadow Stalker and I skid across the asphalt on our back and side. I let out a cry of pain as I slam into the edge of where the sidewalk meets the street.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Has Bitch double back for us? (Almost Certain) [97] No. We're on our own for the moment.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Shadow Stalker bug out of here? I'd normally say Likely, but I feel like she'd be more committed after my calling her out earlier. (Unlikely) [44] No, she hangs in there.</p>
		  <p>I try to hide where I am with bug clones.<br>
		  <strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+1 shadow, +2 bug health) [1, 8 vs 4] Weak hit. Take +1 forward. I successfully obscure my location.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I call my swarm to myself, covering my body in bugs while forming decoys across the street. The Siberian rounds the corner to find six of "me" laid out in various positions of collapse, looking like we'd all been thrown from the monster dog. As she approaches the swarms and I, we stand in unison. She abruptly stops, unsure of which one is real. After a moment of hesitation, she comes to the conclusion that it doesn't matter. Siberian attacks the closest swarm and it is annihilated, like her body is a windshield traveling at 60 mph. She stalks toward the next.</p>
		<p>Through my swarms, I shout, "Go!" All of us, Shadow Stalker and Angelica included, scatter.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I attempt to evade Siberian.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 edge, +2 bug health, +1 forward) [10, 6 vs 11] Strong hit. Mark progress (4). I distract her enough that we're able to regroup.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I run around the collapsed building as fast as my legs will take me, hot on the tail of Angelica. The dog notices me approaching from behind and slows enough for me to mount her like a horse mid-stride.</p>
		<p>Safely seated on Angelica, I glance around in search of Shadow Stalker. My bugs find her misting through a building just a road over. She alternates between her physical and mist form as she escapes from Siberian, pushing off the street with her physical form and allowing to her lighter-than-air mist form to carry her faster down the street. It's not enough. Siberian has obliterated most of my swarms and is heading towards us. As fast as Shadow Stalker is running, Angelica is faster, making Sophia the obvious target.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to direct Shadow Stalker.<br>
		  <strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+2 heart, +2 bug health) [7, 4 vs 8] Strong hit. Take +2 momentum (9) and +1 forward. I safely direct her.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I draw an arrow in the air with my bugs, indicating the direction for Shadow Stalker to run, which is straight through a building. I pull Angelica to the left, rounding the corner at the next intersection and leading us down the street behind the indicated building.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker mists through the front of the building and enters the street just ahead of us. Not a moment later, the face of the building explodes behind her. Debris flies through her mist and covers the street.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I reach for Shadow Stalker.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 edge, +1 forward) [9, 5 vs 8] Weak hit. Mark progress (5) and fill clock segment (3). I grab her but Siberian is hot on our tail.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Angelica sprints toward Shadow Stalker, and I stretch as far as I can from the side of the dog, putting all of my weight on a bone spike protruding from her back. Shadow Stalker solidifies into her physical form and I grasp her hand, then yank her up and onto Angelica's back. She braces herself against me without a word of thanks.</p>
		<p>Siberian bursts from out of the hole in the building face and rockets towards us. She is not far behind; all distance put between us has been lost.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Let's try this again.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Grue realize that we're in trouble yet? (Almost Certain) [68] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In a cloud of darkness, Bitch and Grue enter the street riding Bastard. Through the enveloping shadows I can sense them pull up beside us, the two dogs now running in tandem.</p>
		<p>"We can't shake her!" I shout to Grue through the darkness, though I can't hear my own voice.</p>
		<p>My swarm sense informs me of danger as Siberian snags a minivan with one hand as she passes it, without losing any momentum, and hurls it like a damn football at us. I shout a warning to Grue and pull on Angelica to dodge the projectile.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to get Angelica to avoid it.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 heart) [6, 10 vs 8] Weak hit. Mark progress (6) and fill clock segment (4). We dodge but we're split up again.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We separate to avoid the incoming object. Both Bastard and Angelica clear the projectile and I feel rather than hear the vehicle impact the ground between us. Bits of glass and metal bounce off my arms and legs but I'm unharmed. The same appears to be true for the others.</p>
		<p>Before our dogs can rejoin, the street splits into a Y-intersection and we are naturally guided down opposite streets. Attempting to turn the negative into a positive, I send a swarm of my bugs to Bitch and Grue and write "HIDE" in the air. Siberian will now have to find us while blind.</p>
		<p>I can feel when Grue takes notice of my sign and instructs Bitch to park Bastard on a side street. The monstrous dog would stand out like a sore thumb if it weren't for the clouds of darkness rolling out from Grue and filling the streets for blocks in all directions. It's thanks to that cloud of darkness that our group is able to hide as well. The darkness doesn't spread quite as far over here, the buildings between us and Grue obstructing its progression, but it's enough.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Trying to hide from Siberian in the darkness.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+1 shadow) [7, 1 vs 7] Weak hit. Make progress (7) and fill clock segment (5). I hide but it's temporary.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Siberian plows straight into the building that divided intersection into a Y. Again, the sound is muffled but I can feel the vibrations of the destruction rumble in my chest. It's actually a series of vibrations, making me think that she is having a bit of a temper tantrum. I can't tell for sure because the destruction that she is inflicting keeps killing my bugs in the area.</p>
		<p>I remain as still as I can, though my heart feels like it's going to beat out of my chest. I can feel Shadow Stalker's chest rapidly rise and fall against my back. On the other street, my bugs sense Bitch doing her best to calm Bastard. Angelica is behaving well despite the situation, but Bastard—being a wolf pup rather than a mature dog—is raring to fight.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Bastard disregard Bitch and attack? (Unlikely) [64] No. She maintains control.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Bitch manages to keep Bastard in check, but time is running out; either Bastard will make their presence known or the darkness will disappear and expose us. It seems like the cloud filling our street is already starting to lighten as it thins. I edge Angelica into a darker portion of the cloud by backing up against the wall of the building, clinging to cover for as long as it lasts.</p>
		<p>Inside the building, Siberian has finally calmed. From what I can tell with my bugs, the first floor of the building was once a niche shoppe selling antique lamps and lighting fixtures. Somewhat ironic given that it's plunged in darkness from which light cannot escape. Not that anything remains in a functioning state capable of providing light now.</p>
		<p>Blindly feeling her way, Siberian passes the threshold of the shoppe and enters our street. Shadow Stalker feels me stiffen and she sucks in a breath, trusting my judgement that she should be frightened. Siberian drags her long fingernails along the brickwork of the shoppe's exterior. The nails don't tear into brick, but rather the brick simply separates on a molecular level, leaving clean and smooth trails from her fingers. She follows the wall leading toward us.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is there enough darkness to edge around the corner of the building? [97] No. I'm backed into a corner. </p>
		  <p>I'll command Angelica to make a break for it.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (+2 heart) [5, 1 vs 3] Weak hit. Mark progress (8) and fill clock segment (6). We break away but Siberian notices. The clock is full so I'll end it with the next move.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I reach up and hold Shadow Stalker's hand against me to indicate that she should hold on tight. I spur on the dog as if it were a horse and it breaks into a run. Angelica bursts through the darkness and into the daylight. The exposure to the light hurts my eyes, so I close them and rely on my bugs. With those bugs I can sense Siberian launch herself in our direction.</p>
		<p>"No, no, no!" Shadow Stalker repeats in horror as she watches Siberian gain on us over her shoulder.</p>
		<p>I hang a right and head towards the others. Siberian turns with us. I use my swarm to draw an arrow and write "GO" in the sky above them. Following the instruction, Bitch sets Bastard into motion and they barrel down the street with us close behind and Siberian getting closer, tearing up the pavement with each step.</p>
		<p>"Keep your darkness up!" I yell to Grue. We have only one way out of this and the plan will fail if Siberian has visibility. Straight ahead is our destination; I can feel it with my bugs. Crater Lake.</p>
		<p>Crater Lake is a remnant of the fight with Leviathan. The Endbringer sunk the center of the city below the water table and created a lake so large that you can't make out the opposite shore when standing at its edge. This is where I plan to dump Siberian.</p>
		<p>Angelica is running parallel with Bastard now. Through my bugs I feel Grue looking at me. Since he can see through the darkness, he must know what I plan to do. In fact, the plan is much as it has been since the start: blind Siberian and make our escape. We're just in a better location to make that tactic stick.</p>
		<p>As we near the lake, I point to the left and shout out the direction. Grunt taps Bitch on the shoulder and she steers Bastard away from the lake.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>It's time to end this one way or another.<br>
		  <strong>Finish the Scene:</strong> (8 progress) [6, 1] Strong hit. Remove <em>Escape Siberian</em> scene objective. We finally lose Siberian.</p>
		  <p><strong>Reach a Milestone:</strong> Mark progress on <em>Remove the Slaughterhouse Nine</em> vow (2).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Running blind, Siberian plows ahead into the large body of water. The water parts like Moses and the Red Sea in her wake, sending the displaced water into the air like a geyser.</p>
		<p>I don't know whether Siberian will reach the other end of the lake before she can stop, but I'm not waiting around to find out. Bitch and I push our dogs to exit the area as fast as they can while Grue covers our tracks with darkness, just to be safe. </p>
		<p>We don't stop running until we reach Grue's base. Exhausted and hurting all over, we dismount the dogs, and all but Bitch make our way inside. She stays behind to shrink the dogs back to normal size. Grue leads us to what is essentially the lounge of his base and I collapse onto his comfortable leather couch. I close my eyes and feel exhaustion pulling me into the dark abyss of sleep.</p>
		<p>Today has been a hell of a day.</p>
