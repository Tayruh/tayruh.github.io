		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Angry d6</em>. Remove <em>Caked d8</em> complication. She got cleaned up.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Remove <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication. Her nap sobered her up.<br>
		  <strong>Cami:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Insecure d8</em>. Remove <em>Ashamed d6</em> complication. She escaped to her room to center herself.</p>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d8, Insecurity d8) [3, 8, 3] = 11 (d8)<br>
		  <strong>Jess:</strong> While we're gone, she attempts to soothe Cami's insecurity. (Yandere d8, Cami d10, Presence d6, Treat d8) [5, 1, 1, 2] =  7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		   <strong>Cami:</strong> Take <em>Insecure d12</em> stress and gain a PP (2) from 2 hitches. Jess tries to convince Cami that she should stop worrying about me because I'm a human and I don't matter, but highlighting the differences between us only makes Cami even more upset.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Seoyun, Finola, and I head into town to hit the local grocery store. [1] Altered Scene. [Actions: Conceal Balance] Someone or something is off-balance?<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have difficulty hiding her tails? (50/50) [67] No.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is Finola still drunk? (50/50) [14] Yes. I thought it'd be out of her system after her nap, but nope.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Take <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication.</p>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Halloween is soon. Is it today? (50/50) [23] Yes. It's Halloween night right now.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Are the streets crowded? (Likely) [69] No. Surprisingly, the streets are not full of trick-or-treaters at the moment.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>After helping Finola get cleaned up, I ventured to Seoyun's room on the second floor, with the little faerie cradled in my hands since she had still not sobered. I knocked on the door and it opened a moment later.</p>
		<p>Seoyun stood in the doorway, one arm braced against the frame like she were posing for a photo shoot. She greeted me with a vulpine smile and glittering amber eyes.</p>
		<p>"Seth."</p>
		<p>The sheer weight of the sensuality dripping from her voice resonated within me, and I instinctually felt the need to either throw myself at her or run for the hills. Instead, I held Finola closer to me and straightened my back.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Seoyun. I need to head into town to pick up some snack supplies for our celebration, and I thought that if you wanted to stretch your legs some, I could really use your help," I suggested.</p>
		<p>Seoyun tilted her head forward, her eyes never leaving mine, and her long wavy auburn hair flowed around her face to frame her features perfectly, like she had practiced the maneuver hundreds of times, which she may have.</p>
		<p>"A road trip. Just you and I?" she practically purred, her fox ears twitching in excitement.</p>
		<p>I cleared my throat, then nodded toward Finola. "And this little troublemaker."</p>
		<p>Seoyun's eyes narrowed and she pulled back, crinkling her nose as though I were holding a bundle of sweaty gym socks rather than an adorable but intoxicated little girl. "Bah. Finola? I'll have to think about it."</p>
		<p>"Please?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have a condition for agreeing to help me? (50/50) [47] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Actions: Ambush Exterior] She wants to hunt.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Her eyes flicked back and forth between the faerie and me as she debated. Finally, she huffed and said, "Fine, but I have a condition."</p>
		<p>"What is it?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun flipped her hair over her shoulder in a motion reminiscent of Cami. "If you're getting snacks, I want a snack, too. It's been far too long since I've hunted."</p>
		<p>I frowned while I considered the implications. Seoyun was a kumiho, also known as a nine-tailed fox spirit, and as such, she needed to feed off the spirit energy of humans to sustain herself. Obviously I didn't want anyone hurt, but I also couldn't deny a guest sustinence, and furthermore, anything that happened outside the grounds of the boarding house was technically no longer our responsibility.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." I sighed, dropping my shoulders a fraction. "Yeah, okay. Just be careful."</p>
		<p>Seoyun darted forward and planted a kiss on my cheek before I could respond.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, sweetie," she crooned, then quickly disappeared down the hallway toward the stairs, two large and fluffy fox tails trailing behind her.</p>
		<p>From my hands, I heard Finola singing, "Seoyun and Seth, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G."</p>
		<p>I hung my head and groaned, causing the little girl to break down into a fit of giggles.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything happen on the way into town? (Unlikely) [3] Exceptional yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What happens? [Actions: Free Elements] It begins downpouring.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Moments later, the kumiho and I got into my sporty hatchback and headed into town with Finola resting in the back seat.</p>
		<p>The dirt road leading into the town of Forest Glen was long and winding, framed by thick barriers of trees on both sides. The surrounding forest went on as far as the eye could see, rising along the hills that encircled the town, and gave the distinct feeling that the town and the boarding house were cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
		<p>Night was fully upon us and the rain was falling in sheets. The downpour blocked out the moonlight and turned the dirt road into muddy slop. It was probably insane for me to drive in these conditions, but I was determined to make this anniversary celebration a success, and for that we needed party supplies.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d6, Downpour d10) [2, 1,5] = 7 (d4)<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> I try driving safely through the night rain. (Housemaster d8, Seoyun d8, Awareness d6, Drive d6) [1, 1, 4, 3] = 7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Bargain Tactic] My mistake gives Seoyun something to hold over my head later.<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> Take <em>Insecure d4</em> stress. Take <em>Guilt Material d8</em> complication and gain a PP (2) from hitches. I'm frustrated at my inability to keep my guest safe, but Seoyun finds it hilarious and will probably use it against me.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is Seoyun discussing? [Character Conversations: Praise / Quiet] She's going off about how brave I am. Who knows if she's being serious or not.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"I can barely see anything in this, even with my night vision. You are <em>so</em> brave to be driving in this storm, Seth," Seoyun said in admiration as she peered through the windshield, though I doubted her sincerity.</p>
		<p>I kept my eyes focused on what little I could see of the road. "It's just a bit further. We'll be fine."</p>
		<p>Seoyun laughed merrily. "Oh, I have no doubt."</p>
		<p>She grasped my knee to punctuate her statement, startling me. The timing couldn't have been worse, and I oversteered as I entered the next turn. The backend of the car kicked out and we began to drift around the bend, nearly going sideways. Seoyun laughed in delight, and her hand squeezed my knee as I worked the accelerator and clutch, steering into the slide to right the vehicle. My heart was pounding in my chest and my knuckles were white from my death grip on the steering wheel, but we were now facing the proper direction as we zoomed down the treacherous road through the blinding rain.</p>
		<p>"Dammit," I grumbled under my breath.</p>
		<p>I could sense Seoyun grinning at me out of the corner of my eye. "You almost killed us!" She sounded thrilled.</p>
		<p>We both knew that I was the only one of the three in the car that was at risk of going out in an embarrassing vehicular death, but I didn't feel the need to correct her or fuel her teasing.</p>
		<p>When I didn't respond, the kumiho chuckled softly and ruffled my hair. "You're no fun. Just relax and enjoy the drive." She withdrew her hand and gazed out her window. "The rain is really soothing."</p>
		<p>Seoyun wasn't wrong, and while the driving conditions never improved, eventually the quiet in the car and the sounds of the rain beating on the roof lulled me into a state of calm. The remainder of our trip into town was blessedly uneventful. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Increase CF to 6.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Seoyun, Finola, and I go shopping. [4] Interrupt Scene. [Event Focus: NPC Action][Actions: Expose Benefits] Seoyun takes her chance at hunting before we go shopping.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We arrived in town and parked in the small lot beside the Village Market, our local mom-and-pop grocery store. I roused the sleeping faerie and convinced her to hide away in the hood of my light jacket, then Seoyun and I exited the car and dashed through the rain for cover under the awning hanging above the store entrance. Once out of the rain and I had ensured that Finola was still nestled safely and out of sight, I glanced at my kumiho companion. </p>
		<p>Seoyun had absorbed her fox ears and tails, and now appeared indisguishable from your average human, other than looking like a supermodel who was apparently slumming it in a backwater town. Her auburn hair was drenched and clung to her cheeks and forehead, but as typical of her, the wet bangs somehow only managed to make her look even more seductive. Seoyun was looking at me expectantly.</p>
		<p>I furrowed my brow. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I'm hungry," she replied calmly, but with the eyes of a predator.</p>
		<p>I sighed in exasperation. "You want to do this now?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun merely smiled in response, the light from the shop entrance glinting off her canines.</p>
		<p>"Oooh. This'll be fun," Finola chirped from my jacket hood.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is there an obvious victim in the vicinity? (50/50) Otherwise she'll have to track. [66] No. She'll have to rely on her supernatural senses.</p>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d6, Rain d6) [6, 2, 2] = 8 (d6)<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> She tries to locate someone with scent. (Kumiho d8, Seth d10, Awareness d6, Canine Senses d6, Notice d8) [2, 1, 2, 6, 1] = 10 (d4). Spent a PP (0) to keep an extra effort die. Success.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Betray Protection] Her actions and appearance make it difficult for her to blend in.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> Take <em>Remarkable d8</em> complication and gain a PP (1) from hitches.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Where is the victim located? [Locations: Welcoming / Horrible] They're in a haunted house.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Without saying another word, Seoyun walked past me and entered the rain. I grumbled to myself and followed her.</p>
		<p>The kumiho lead me around to the back of the grocery store, which happened to be marked by a series of signs indicating a haunted house. It was Halloween, after all, though I had forgotten that the owners of the Village Market liked to host their own little spooky event every year. There was quite a crowd when I had caught the event last year, but the downpour had seemingly taken its toll on the turnout for tonight's event.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Are there are any other visitors here? (Very Unlikely) [88] Exceptional no. Not only is the place empty, the employee isn't even manning their station.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun and I reached the store's back room. The large overhead bay door was raised, revealing a maze of black sheets hanging from the ceiling, filling the space of the loading dock and recycling center that I was familiar with. A cheap skeleton had been propped beside the bay door, with its arm extended and a boney finger pointing toward what I assumed was the entrance to the maze.</p>
		<p>Seoyun deduced the same, and she flashed me a grin before disappearing into the maze. Finola cackled over my shoulder and urged me on excitedly. I shushed her, then entered the maze as well.</p>
		<p>I quickly caught up with Seoyun, as the "maze" was in fact a twisting but linear path. The sheeted corridor hedging us in was narrow and dark, with illumination provided solely by fake candles and an overhead strobe light. A looping audio track of spooky noises droned on from the store's PA system at a volume a bit louder than was necessary. The combined assault to my senses gave the impression that nothing existed beyond this small space inhabited by me and Seoyun. …and Finola.</p>
		<p>Seoyun held her hand out to me, and I hesitated for a moment, then shrugged and placed my hand in hers. Her grin was so wide that I thought her face was going to split in two. Finola snickered to herself behind my ear.</p>
		<p>Seoyun happily tugged me down the sheet maze until we reached the epicenter.</p>
