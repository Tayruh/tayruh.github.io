This example was compiled with the **Kayako** compiler using `demo.sko` as the source file.

Notice that this example does not require `kayako.js`. That is because the sadako script has been precompiled into a JS file and included into the page. `kayako.js` is only for compiling and therefore is unnecessary for precompiled script.
