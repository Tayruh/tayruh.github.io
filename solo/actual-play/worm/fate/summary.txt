[Stunts]
Bug Control – Because she has fine control over thousands of bugs simultaneously, Skitter gets +2 when using her bugs to create an advantage with Craft (eg. web nets, decoys).

Omniscience – Because her bugs are her eyes and ears everywhere, Skitter gets +2 when using her using her bugs to overcome an obstacle with Notice.

Armored Costume – Because Skitter's costume is made of spider-silk and insect carapaces, she gets armor:2 against physical attacks when she is wearing it. The costume also has compartments to hold spider-silk rope, pepper spray, smelling salts, a collapsible baton, and a combat knife.
