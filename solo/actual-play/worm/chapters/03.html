		<p>As Shadow Stalker and I walked toward Tattletale's base, I give her a call to let her know that we are coming. As I speak, I steal glances at Shadow Stalker. She has this inexplicable grin on her face. It's not a happy grin, but rather the same expression that she would use when looking down on me after dousing me with grape juice or stealing my backpack. Maybe she thinks that she bullied her way into this outcome as well. Whatever.</p>
		<p>"Tattletale, I'm coming to see you. I have company," I say into my phone as we walk.</p>
		<p>"You have cell service?" Shadow Stalker asks incredulously. Not surprising though. It's nearly impossible to find reception or power in Brockton Bay after the Endbringer attack. Though we're doing our best to restore the latter.</p>
		<p>"Is that who I think it is?" Lisa asks in surprise on the other end of the line.</p>
		<p>I grumble, "Yeah, it's her."</p>
		<p>Lisa is quiet for a moment, then asks, "Are you okay?" She doesn't mean physically.</p>
		<p>"Not entirely," I answer honestly. "But better with us than the Nine, right?"</p>
		<p>Lisa sighs. "Yeah, you're right. Okay. Bring her around to the back."</p>
		<p>I hang up. Lisa clearly doesn't trust Shadow Stalker either. Lisa's base is housed in a shelter. It's not technically a front, since it does in fact function as a shelter for the community, but it's very much intended to hide her base in plain sight. She wouldn't just walk someone she didn't trust in through the front door.</p>
		<p>I lead Shadow Stalker around the long way, taking extraneous turns to obscure the location of the base. She is becoming impatient and tired of walking, but I couldn't care less.</p>
		<p>We finally arrive at Tattletale's base. As always there is military personnel on guard, but they wave us on through with a nod. My bugs locate Tattletale. She is in costume and sitting in the room that she has reserved for mission planning. She whispers something in a kind voice to the fly on her shoulder, perhaps a greeting but I can't make it out.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker and I make our way through the halls of the base to the mission room. I knock and Tattletale calls us to enter. Tattletale is sitting on the edge of a long conference table, her legs dangling off the side. Behind her is a large whiteboard with hastily erased mission details. She gives me a sad smile when my nemesis steps out from behind me.</p>
		<p>"Hey there, Sophia," Tattletale says. Always with the powerplay.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker flinches at her name, then glares at me. I shrug and roll my eyes. "I didn't tell her. It's Tattletale. Of course she already knows."</p>
		<p>Tattletale grins at me, ignoring Shadow Stalker. "So, I hear you've had an adventurous morning. First Mannequin and then Shadow Stalker?"</p>
		<p>"What?" Shadow Stalker asks in shock. "You fought Mannequin? Alone?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Again," I groan, rubbing my face. "But I think that he was just playing with me this time. It was barely a fight."</p>
		<p>"You? Mannequin?" Stalker Stalker asks again in disbelief.</p>
		<p>Tattletale laughs. "Poor Sophia. You really don't know who Skitter is, do you."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker scoffs. "She's Taylor. A pathetic loser that can't even stand up for herself."</p>
		<p>"Is that what you think? Do you really think that she can't?" Tattletale gives her the patented vulpine smile. "Have you considered that maybe she chose not to? That she's been holding her anger in check for the safety of the students? That she could kill everyone in that goddamn school without even leaving her seat?"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker scowls at her, but it's pretty clear the gears are turning, albeit slowly.</p>
		<p>"That's right," Tattletale continues, incredibly pleased with herself. "You've literally been kicking the beehive this whole time and didn't even realize it. You stupid bitch."</p>
		<p>"Tattletale," I interject before Shadow Stalker can reply. "While I appreciate the support, this isn't productive. We need to discuss her potential membership and the Nine."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm going to say that Tattletale's insight causes Sophia to rethink her past interactions with Taylor.<br>
		  <strong>Develop Your Relationship:</strong> Mark progress on <em>Shadow Stalker</em> connection (1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Fine," Tattletale huffs, then turns to Shadow Stalker. "You're thinking to join us then? Are you sure?"</p>
		<p>"Why wouldn't I be?" Shadow Shadow asks with a tone of defiance.</p>
		<p>Tattletale shrugs with her palms up. "The better question is 'why <em>would</em> you be?' You'll be taking orders from Skitter here, for one. And two, you'll definitely be swinging above your weight class."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker looks side-eyed at me but answers Tattletale, "Do you think I'm a pussy?"</p>
		<p>"Ha. No. What I do think is that we're <em>all</em> swinging above our weight class. I mean, the Undersiders against the Nine?" Tattletale shakes her head. "But this is what we do. We take the long odds and come out on top. And usually it's because of our battlefield tactician here," she waves her hand in my direction, "the pathetic loser that can't stand up for herself."</p>
		<p>"Tattletale..," I groan.</p>
		<p>"Fine, fine. You ruin all my fun." Tattletale hops from the table to her feet. "Anyway, if you can accept those conditions, you're in. Lord knows we'll need all the help we can get."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker gives a firm nod.</p>
		<p>And so that she doesn't get any ideas, I say, "Just remember that Regent can assume control of your body at any point now that he's already had it once. So don't even think of trying to backstab us."</p>
		<p>She scowls at me, which I take for assent.</p>
		<p>"Right!" Tattletale says, clapping her hands together. "Slaughterhouse Nine. What's the plan?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Let's leave the plan up to chance.<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Move Solution] Relocating something is the key. What is it?<br>
		  <strong>Descriptor+Focus:</strong> [Subsurface Equipment] This sounds like Noelle to me, but I can't think of any plausible reason to move her. She'd be too dangerous in any location other than where she is already. We'll try again. (I'll explain Noelle later. Skitter isn't supposed to know who she is at this point of the story.)<br>
		  <strong>Descriptor+Focus:</strong> [Radiant Artifact] This sounds like Purity. That fits nicely my with task from Coil to recruit The Pure. And I guess that means that "move" is more like "set in motion".</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Coil wanted me to request assistance from The Pure," I shrug.</p>
		<p>"Those racist fucks?" Shadow Stalker growls.</p>
		<p>"Yeah," I sigh in resignation. "None of us are fans of them either, but apparently our feelings have no bearing on Coil's plan."</p>
		<p>In her silence I feel like I can hear Shadow Stalker already reconsidering her choice to join.</p>
		<p>"That's a good idea, if I'm honest. They have a lot more firepower than we do, that's for sure," Tattletale says, then smirks. "And with any luck we can use them as meatshields against the Nine and kill two birds with one stone."</p>
		<p>"I can get behind that," Shadow Stalker agrees with a nod.</p>
		<p>I nod as well. "Then I guess I'm off to have a chat with Purity. Shadow Stalker, you should come. If talks go south you can shoot some neo-nazis."</p>
		<p>"To that end, I'm going to call Grue and Bitch and have them join you. The Pure aren't anyone to take lightly," Tattletale says.</p>
		<p>"Agreed. I'll catch you later," I say and head off with Shadow Stalker to meet up with Grue.</p>
