On a 7-9, choose 2.<<Your group suffers little harm|Your group inflicts terrible harm|Your group seizes a vital position|Your group avoids collateral damage>>",
				"Suffering Harm as a Group": "Any group that suffers six (or more) harm is broken and unable to fight. At that point, the group dissolves; there are simply too many injured and dead to keep fighting. Characters who are leading groups that take six or more harm cannot lead those groups into battle any longer, even if they themselves still have the capacity to keep fighting.||When a group suffers harm, you can use the following guidelines to translate the damage.<<1-2 harm: some injuries, a few minor to moderate, no fatalities|3-4 harm: many injuries, several serious, possibly a couple of fatalities|5-6 harm: widespread serious injuries, many fatalities>>",
				"Solo Fights": "When you [bring friends to a fight], roll with Allies.((pbta))On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 2.<<You suffer little harm|Your allies suffer little harm|Your enemies suffer terrible harm|You take something from your enemies>>",
				"Managing Debts": "When you {Cash in a Debt} with an NPC for anything off the list, roll with Debts (max +3).((pbta))On a 10+, they’ll do what you ask to pay their interest; mark their Faction, but keep the Debt. On a 7-9, they’ll do it, but it’s costly; mark their Faction and lose the Debt. On a miss, they push you off until another day: keep the Debt, but take -1 ongoing against them for the rest of the scene.",
				"Advancement": "When you make a Faction move, trigger an intimacy move, cash in a Debt, or honor a Debt, mark the Faction involved. When you’ve marked all four Factions, erase the marks and advance.",
				"Harm": "The different levels of harm reflect how badly your character is hurt, moving up from minor injuries to wounds that require immediate medical attention:<<[Faint harm] is relatively minor, like getting stabbed in a nonvital area or getting into a fist fight that doesn’t last too long. Most characters can shrug off faint wounds by taking a day or two off and getting some rest.|[Grievous harm] is serious stuff, like getting shot in the shoulder or hit by a car. If you suffer grievous harm, you need to get medical attention to keep things from getting worse, but you’ll be back on your feet in a few days.|[Critical harm] means that you’re on the verge of dying, like get-ting shot in the stomach or beat repeatedly in the head with a metal baseball bat. If you don’t get to a hospital—or find some magic to patch you up—you’re going to die.>>Harm is a simple metric for evaluating how much physical damage an attack does, a rough approximation that differentiates throwing a punch from shooting a gun. Here are some ways to think about how harm shows up in the fiction:<<1-harm is rough but blunt trauma: fists and baseball bats, punches thrown at a rock concert, the kind of thing people sleep off after a bad night.|2-harm is painful and obvious: a gunshot wound, a bad car wreck, wounds that are impossible to hide without bandages and slings.|3-harm is worse than all that: a bullet at point-blank range, a sword cleaving tendon and bone, a beating that leaves you unrecognizable for a week.|4-harm means instant death to a mortal human and weeks of pain and recovery for supernatural creatures: a grenade blast at close range, losing a limb or internal organ, falling off the top of a ten-story building.>>",
				"Scars": "Your character has four scars available:<<Shattered: (-1 Blood)|Crushed: (-1 Heart)|Fractured: (-1 Mind)|Broken: (-1 Spirit)>>[Shattered] means frightened, weakened, and overly cautious. Shattered char-acters hesitate when they should move, and their attempts to {Unleash an Attack} on someone or {Escape a Situation} often come up short.||[Crushed] means traumatized, timid, and uncertain. Crushed characters bear the full weight of the wounds they’ve suffered, and their attempts to {Persuade an NPC} are inhibited by their reticent approach to conflict.||[Fractured] means confused, disoriented, and disjointed. Fractured characters are unstable and unsure, and their attempts to {Figure Someone Out} or {Mislead, Distract, or Trick} others are unfocused and imprecise.||[Broken] means hopeless, forlorn, and cowardly. Broken characters have lost their will to fight, and their attempts to {Keep Your Cool|Keep Their Cool} or {Let It Out} are often half-hearted and incomplete.",
				"Session Intro": "At the beginning of every session, announce which character your character trusts the least; their player will spotlight a Faction for your character (that isn’t already marked). Mark that Faction. Tell the MC about a rumor or conflict that you’ve heard about that Faction, building on previous established information if you’d like, and roll with the Faction.((pbta))On a 10+, you’re prepared for the conflict you laid out: you’ve got a Debt on someone in that Faction or a useful piece of information or equipment, your choice. On a 7-9, you’re neck deep in it: you owe someone in that Faction a Debt, and someone in that Faction owes a Debt to you. On a miss, you’re caught flat-footed, unprepared, or unaware: the MC will tell you who is coming at you.||If you start a session in the middle of a chaotic situation or with plenty going on already, the MC might decide to skip this move.",
				"Session End": "At the end of every session, if you learned something meaningful about a Faction, increase your score in that Faction by 1 and decrease your score in a different Faction by 1.

				"Keep Your Cool": "When things get real and you [keep your cool], tell the MC the situation you want to avoid and roll with [Spirit].((pbta))On a 10+, all’s well. On a 7–9, the MC will tell you what it’s gonna cost you.||[Advanced:] On a 12+, your opposition’s cool is compromised. Tell them what it will cost to maintain their current course of action.",
				"Let It Out": "When you [let out the power within you], choose an ability from your playbook and roll with [Spirit].((pbta))On a hit, mark corruption and activate the ability; the MC will tell you how the effect is costly, limited, or unstable. On a 10+, ignore the corruption or the complications, your choice.||[Advanced:] On a 12+, your powers or abilities manifest in an unexpectedly useful way. Mark corruption to make that manifestation a new ability.",
				"Lend a Hand or Get in the Way": "When you [lend a hand or get in the way] after a PC has rolled, roll with [their Circle].((pbta))On a hit, give them a +1 or -2 to their roll. On a 7-9, you expose yourself to danger, entanglement, or cost.",
				"Put a Name to a Face": "When [you put a name to a face or vice versa], roll with [their Circle].((pbta))On a hit, you know their reputation; the MC will tell you what most people know about them.

				"Do Someone a Favor": "When you [do someone a favor], they owe you a Debt.",
				"Interfere in Someone’s Business": "When you [interfere in someone’s business], you owe them a Debt.",
				"Refuse to Honor a Debt": "When you [refuse to honor a Debt], roll with [the difference in Status between you and your creditor].((pbta))On a hit, you weasel out of the obligation for now, but you still owe the Debt. On a 7-9, you owe them an additional Debt or mark corruption, your choice.

				"Cash in a Debt": "When you [cash in a Debt], remind your debtor why they owe you in order to...||...make a PC:<<answer a question honestly|do you a favor at moderate cost|{Lend a Hand or Get in the Way|Lend a Hand} to your efforts|{Lend a Hand or Get in the Way|Get in the Way} of someone else|erase a Debt they hold on someone|give you a Debt they hold on someone else>>...make an NPC:<<answer a question honestly|arrange a meeting with an NPC in their Circle|grant you a worthy boon or useful gift|erase a Debt they hold on someone|give you a Debt they hold on someone else>>",
				"Weaken Someone’s Standing": "When you try to [weaken someone’s standing] in a Circle with rumor and gossip, roll with [Status].((pbta))On a hit, the rumors take hold; they take -1 ongoing to moves during the faction turn until they ﬁnd some way to dispel the whispers. On a 10+, one of their enemies catches wind of your gossip and approaches you with damaging information about your target’s interests. On a miss, your target traces the stories directly back to you...and catches you in a vulnerable spot before you can react.",
				"Put Out the Word": "When you [put out the word you need something to your Circle]—a magical tome, secret information, a skilled bodyguard, etc.—roll with [Status].((pbta))On a 10+, it shows up in the hands of an ally; it’s yours for a Debt. On a 7-9, it ends up with a rival; they want a favor or gift—their choice—in addition to a Debt before they hand it over. On a miss, the thing shows up on your doorstep with wicked strings attached, exposing you to the wrath of a Status-3 NPC from another Circle.",
				"Consult Your Contacts": "When you [consult your contacts in another Circle], roll with [Status in that Circle].((pbta))On a hit, ask 3; your contacts will answer to the best of their ability. On a 7-9, hold 1. On a 10+, hold 2. Spend your hold—1 for 1—to take a 10+ instead of rolling when the information you gained would aid you on a move.<<What conﬂict is everyone talking about?|What happened to ________?|What has ________ been up to recently?|Who is responsible for ________?|Who has a Debt on ________?>>On a miss, ask 1 and hold 1, but your contact has a tough question about your loyalties and allegiances as well. Answer it honestly, mark corruption, or owe them a Debt, your choice.",
				"Tend to Your Business": "When you [tend to your business instead of meddling in city affairs], tell the MC how you pass the time and roll.((pbta))On a hit, an old friend or new ally approaches you with a request for help; mark a corruption if you turn them down. On a 10+, ask the MC a question about the situation; they will answer it honestly. On a miss, an NPC interrupts your day-to-day business to cash in a Debt you hoped they had forgotten about, mixing you up in a mess within your Circle you’d rather have avoided.",
				"Marshall Faction Forces": "When you [try to marshall forces in your Circle to undermine a faction or their holdings], roll with [Status].((pbta))On a hit, you can give a Debt to a powerful NPC of your Circle—MC’s choice—to reduce your target’s strength or weaken their hold on a speciﬁc asset, your choice. On a 7-9, your allies are slow to move; give them another Debt to speed things along, or join them directly in the attack. On a miss, the attack falls apart and creates an opportunity for your enemies; tell the MC how you’ve left yourself vulnerable to them.",
				"Lay Claim": "When you [lay claim to a vulnerable asset], roll with [Status].((pbta))On a hit, your claim is broadly recognized; take hold of the asset and the MC will tell you what beneﬁts it brings. On a 7-9, pick 1. On a 10+, all 3.<<the asset is no longer vulnerable|the asset has no rival claimant|the asset doesn’t require you to cash in a Debt>>On a miss, your claim puts you in the crosshairs of a Status-3 NPC who desires the asset as well; your claim falls short, and the MC will tell you which of your allies or assets the Status-3 NPC is targeting in an attempt to scare you off.",
				"Recruit New Allies": "When you [recruit allies from another Circle], tell the MC what assistance you require and roll with [Status].((pbta))On a hit, the MC will tell you who is available for hire; offer up a Debt, and they’ll be on call until after the next faction turn. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 2:<<they are unfailingly honest|they are exceptionally skilled|they are notably discrete|they are aggressively focused>>On a miss, before you can connect with anyone, someone in your own Circle catches word of your request and spreads rumors of your weakness; take -1 ongoing to your Status until you prove your strength to your own people.",
				"Claiming Status-3": "When you [make a claim for Status-3 in the city], roll.<<If you have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over a Size 2+ faction, add 1.|If you have six Debts over Status-3 NPCs, add 1.|If you have Status-0 in more than one Circle, subtract 1.|If you personally control fewer than two assets, subtract 1.>>((pbta))On a hit, raise your status to Status-3 and gain control of a relevant faction. On a 10+, your rise to power begets new alliances and opportunities; make an additional city move for the next two faction turns. On a 7-9, your rise leads to animosity and jealousy within your own ranks; another member of your faction leaves to join another faction, taking an asset of yours with them. On a miss, your ascent is blocked by a Status-3 NPC who loathes you and your allies; you cannot make another claim until you win them over… or eliminate them directly.",				
				"Openly Attack a Faction": "When a faction [openly attacks] another faction, roll with [the difference between the two factions’ Sizes].((pbta))On a hit, the targeted faction sacriﬁces an appropriate asset or loses a point of Size, their choice. On a 7-9, the attacking faction must sacriﬁce an appropriate asset or lose a point of Size as well. On a miss, the target instead springs a clever trap; they capture or destroy an asset or reduce the attacker’s Size, their choice.",
				"Consolidate Control": "When the leaders of a faction [consolidate control] over their existing forces and assets, roll with their [Strength].((pbta))On a 10+, they pick 2. On a 7-9, they pick 1:<<they secure new holdings; mark resources|they seek new members; mark recruitment|they demand secrecy; cover up another action>>On a miss, their efforts lead to internal strife; an authority is dethroned or humiliated, and a rebel coalition within the faction gains momentum—reduce the faction’s Strength.",
				"Track Someone Down": "When a faction [tries to track a status-1 or status-2 character down] within the city, roll. <<If the faction has a relevant asset, add 1.|If their quarry is of the same Circle, add 1.|If the faction is Size-1 or Strength-1, subtract 1.|If their quarry is actively hiding, subtract 1.>>((pbta))[If the quarry is an NPC]: On a 7-9, the faction ﬁnds their quarry; they attack them, kidnap them, or confront them at some cost. On a 10+, they catch the quarry exposed or vulnerable; the faction can act upon the quarry with impunity. On a miss, the faction’s attempts to track them down succeed, but their agents make a mess of things and allow the quarry to escape unharmed.||[If the quarry is a PC]: On a 7-9, the faction tracks down their location, but the PC has time to prepare for the limited forces coming their way. On a 10+, the tracking faction gets the best of their quarry; they corner the PC with overwhelming force or careful planning that leaves them little room to avoid their pursuers. On a miss, someone close to the PC tips them off early to the faction’s search...and an opportunity or weakness the PC can exploit..",
				"Goad an Opponent": "When a faction tries to [goad an opponent] into making a mistake, roll with [the difference between the two factions’ Strengths].((pbta))On a 10+, the target takes the bait; the instigating faction strikes a terrible blow, destroys a vulnerable asset, or undermines a key relationship or alliance. On a 7-9, the target avoids the worst of the trap, but causes enough trouble to embarrass themselves; they take a -1 ongoing to Strength until they reestablish their reputation. On a miss, the target sees through the scheme; someone from the targeted faction comes to one of the PCs for help turning the tables against the instigating faction.",
				"Seize by Force": "When a faction [seizes something vulnerable by force], roll with [their Strength].((pbta))On a hit, they take hold of it; reduce the targeted faction’s appropriate attribute and seize a vulnerable asset. On a 10+, all three. On a 7-9, they choose one:<<they don’t sacriﬁce an important leader, ally, or asset|they don’t suffer an immediate, retaliatory attack|they don’t cause serious collateral damage>>On a miss, the strike instead results in the utter destruction of the thing the attacking faction attempted to seize; someone comes to one of the PCs looking for help obtaining justice or revenge.",
				"Search the City": "When a faction [searches the city for useful information]—rare occult knowledge, another faction’s weaknesses, the location of an artifact—roll with [their Size].((pbta))On a hit, they uncover some crucial details, enough to ask a PC or notable NPC to pursue it further. On a 7-9, they also pick 2. On a 10+, they also pick 1.<<they attract the attention of a rival faction|they have to make an asset vulnerable|they take -1 ongoing until the end of the next faction turn>>On a miss, a member of the faction who has secured some vital information ends up dead or missing...but not before passing off what they know to one of the PCs.",
				"Advancement": "When you make a [Circle move], make a [city move], trigger an [intimacy move], {Cash in a Debt} or [honor a Debt], {Lend a Hand or Get in the Way|Lend a Hand} or {Lend a Hand or Get in the Way|Get in the Way}, mark the Circle involved. When you’ve marked all four Circles, erase the marks and advance.",
				"Harm": "The different levels of harm reflect how badly your character is hurt, moving from minor injuries to wounds that require immediate medical attention:<<[Faint harm] is minor—getting stabbed in a non-vital area or getting into a fist fight that doesn’t last too long. Most characters can shrug off faint wounds by taking a day or two off and getting some rest.|[Serious harm] is dangerous stuff—getting shot in the shoulder or hit by a car. If you suffer serious harm, you need medical attention to keep things from getting worse, but you’ll be back on your feet in a few days.|[Critical harm] means you’re on the verge of dying, like getting shot in the stomach or beat in the head with a metal bat. If you don’t get to a hospital—or find some magic to patch you up—you’re going to die.>>If your character suffers faint harm, it will heal naturally without any special treatment. But when your character suffers serious or critical harm, your injuries need special attention. You might need to {Hit the Streets} to find a vampire doctor who can patch you up, a faerie who can magically close your wounds, or—at the very least—an old friend to pull bullets out of your back and bandage you up.||Harm Ratings:<<[1-harm] is rough but blunt trauma: ﬁsts and baseball bats, punches thrown at a rock concert, the kind of thing people sleep off after a bad night.|[2-harm] is painful and obvious: a gunshot wound, a bad car wreck, wounds that are impossible to hide without bandages and slings.|[3-harm] is worse than all that: a bullet at point-blank range, a sword cleaving tendon and bone, a beating that leaves you unrecognizable for a week.|[4-harm] means instant death to a mortal human: a grenade blast at close range, losing a limb or internal organ, falling off the top of a ten-story building.>>",
				"Scars": "Your character has four scars available:<<Shattered: (-1 Blood)|Crushed: (-1 Heart)|Fractured: (-1 Mind)|Broken: (-1 Spirit)>>[Shattered] means frightened, weakened, and overly cautious. Shattered characters hesitate when they should move, and their attempts to turn to violence or escape a situation often come up short.||[Crushed] means traumatized, timid, and uncertain. Crushed characters bear the full weight of the wounds they’ve suffered, and their attempts to persuade an NPC are inhibited by their reticent approach to conflict.||[Fractured] means confused, disoriented, and disjointed. Fractured characters are unstable and unsure, and their attempts to figure someone out or mislead, distract, or trick others are unfocused and imprecise.||[Broken] means hopeless, forlorn, and cowardly. Broken characters have lost their will to fight, and their attempts to keep their cool or let it out are often half-hearted.",
				"Basic Moves": "Surface a conflict, ancient or modern.<<Put someone in danger.|Inflict (or trade) harm.|Inflict corruption|Offer an opportunity with a cost.|Reveal a deal done in their absence.|Turn a move back on them.|Offer or claim a Debt owed.|Shift the odds, suddenly or magically.|Warn someone of impending danger.|Lock down, exploit, or claim a place of power.|Tell the consequences and ask.|Activate their stuff’s downside.|After every move: “What do you do?”>>",
				"Offer Passage": "When a faction [offers passage] to someone—into or out of the city—roll with [their Size].((pbta))On a hit, the way is made clear, no matter who opposes it; choose 1:<<someone exits; they are beyond reach until they choose to return|someone enters; the faction gains a powerful asset>>On a 7-9, the passage offends a Status-3 NPC who seeks tribute for the trespass; the faction must perform a favor—dedicating a faction move next faction turn—sacriﬁce an asset, or risk open war. On a miss, the passage sparks a conﬂict between the faction and their own allies before it can be completed; someone comes to one of the PCs seeking help to negotiate a truce.",
				"End of Session": "At the end of every session, decide if you’ve grown closer to a Circle you engaged with this session: increase your score in that Circle and decrease your score in a different Circle. Tell the MC how your relationships to these communities have changed because of the events of the story, and mark one of the two Circles involved in those changes.",
