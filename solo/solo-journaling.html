		<p>This document outlines the main procedures that I follow while journaling my solo games. The purpose of this document is to get this down on paper for myself, and to possibly provide insight for others. It is not intended to declare "this is how journaling should be done," only that this is how I prefer to do it. Your mileage may vary.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
		<p><strong>Player Role:</strong> Determine actions for PC and describe them.</p>
		<p><strong>GM Role:</strong> Determine setting lore. Describe the world. Determine or roll for NPC actions and describe them. Determine actions for GMPCs and describe them.</p>
		<p>Since describing anything outside of the PC is the role of the GM, I believe that when one intends to assume the role of the Player in solo, they are actually assuming the role of the GM controlling a GMPC, even when using oracles to aid in answering questions of the world and NPCs. This guide is presented under assumption that this is the case.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2>
		<p><strong>First Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best with a single PC as a GMPC. Could work as an NPC, as long as they're referred to in third person for questions (eg. "Does Frodo look for traps?").<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• World is described in an opinionated manner by the character, not the GM.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Allows for internal character dialogue.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best in past tense, since it's like you're retelling a story.</p>
		<p><strong>Second Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Only works with a single PC as an NPC, but it's still kind of strange because the "you" would be speaking to the dice, not a real player.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works best in present tense, since its purpose is to put you (or rather, the fictional player) in the moment.</p>
		<p><strong>Third Person</strong><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Works well with any number of PCs as NPCs and/or GMPCs.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Close third person</em> is described by the GM but the narration is heavily influenced by the opinions of the character, even so far as directly injecting their thoughts into the narration. Information is restricted to what the character can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Limited Distant third person</em> is described by the GM following a single character, restricting information to what they can perceive. Unlike Close third person, the character does not influence the narrative, and any internal dialogue is done as thoughts quoted in italics  (eg. "<em>Dammit</em>, he thought.").<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Omniscient Distant third person</em> is like Limited Distant third person, except that it follows more than one character and allows for relaying information beyond what any characters can perceive.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Can work in past or present tense—past follows typical fiction, but present is probably more immersive.</p>
		<p>First person is the ideal perspective when a single character's thoughts and opinions would enhance the narrative. Limited Distant third person is ideal for parties without a main character. Third person perspective in general has many options for narrating and works well in any situation. Second person perspective doesn't work well in roleplaying without a live player. </p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="narration">Narration</h2>
		<p><strong>Story and Chapters</strong></p>
		<p>According to the US Department of Defense, levels of warfare can be broken down into three levels.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Strategic:</strong> The level of warfare at which a nation, often as a member of a group of nations, determines national or multinational (alliance or coalition) strategic security objectives and guidance, then develops and uses national resources to achieve those objectives. (national policy &gt; theater strategy)</p>
		  <p><strong>Operational:</strong> The level of warfare at which campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted, and sustained to achieve strategic objectives within theaters or other operational areas. (campaigns &gt; major operations)</p>
		  <p><strong>Tactical:</strong> The level of warfare at which battles and engagements are planned and executed to achieve military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces. (battles &gt; engagements &gt; small-unit and crew actions)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>That being said, a Story is a collection of Chapters, and Chapters are a collection of Scenes and Sequels. Each Story has a long-term Strategic Objective, each Chapter has a short-term Operational Objective, and each Scene and Sequel has an immediate Tactical Objective. For roleplaying purposes, a Session contains about three to five Chapters, depending on length of Chapters.</p>
		<p>A Chapter ends when the character achieves or fails their Operational Objective. A Chapter contains as many Scenes and Sequels as necessary for the Operational Objective, but usually tends to be about two to five.</p>
		<p>A Scene or Sequel ends when the character achieves or fails their Tactical Objective, can no longer achieve it, or it can only be achieved at another time or location. Scenes and Sequels can be very short and end in only a couple paragraphs, very long and span an entire chapter, or any size in between. It's the content that defines the length.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Scene and Sequel</strong></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Goal &gt; Conflict &gt; Disaster<br>
		  <strong>Sequel:</strong> Reaction &gt; Dilemma &gt; Decision</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Scenes actually come in two forms of structure: what we typically consider a Scene, and its complementary, the Sequel. A Scene is action, where the character works towards a goal. A Sequel is problem solving, where the character determines the correct path forward. Where Scenes are about fixing a problem, Sequels are about analyzing the problem. The two generally alternate, with a Scene leading directly into a Sequel, and a Sequel leading into a Scene. They can double or triple up when necessary, but it should be a rarity.</p>
		<p>A <em>Scene</em> begins with a character Goal, which they have to overcome Conflict to achieve, and then ends with a Disaster. The Conflict refers to any and all things blocking their Goal in this scene. The Disaster is a new problem that the character needs solve, whether they achieved their Goal or not.</p>
		<p>A <em>Sequel</em> begins with the character's instinctive reaction to the Disaster of the previous Scene, then they contemplate their current Dilemma, and then they make a Decision on how to proceed. Contemplating the Dilemma usually takes the form of character dialogue, introspection, or connecting clues. The Decision made determines the Goal of the next Scene.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Motivation and Reaction</strong></p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Motivation &gt; Reaction (Feeling &gt; Action &gt; Speech)</p>
		  <p><strong>Feeling</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>1.</small> Instinctive Action (flinching, gasping) <br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2.</small>  Sensory Input (pain, sound)<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>3.</small>  Emotion (anger, confusion)<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>4.</small>  Involuntary Action (heart pounding, stumbling)<br>
		   <strong>Action</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>5.</small>  Unplanned Action (ducking, reaching for gun)<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>6.</small>  Thoughts (inner monologue)<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>7.</small>  Planned Action (counter-punch, aimed shot)<br>
		   <strong>Speech</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>8.</small>  Speech (spoken words) </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Scenes and Sequels are divided up into repeating blocks of Motivation and Reaction as a call and response:<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• something in the world changes (sensory input, something acts, someone speaks) that requires a response from the character, giving them Motivation to react<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• the character then responds with a Feeling, an Action, and/or Speech (in that order) as their Reaction, creating change in the world<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• the effect that this change has on the world is then shown, and the world continues on from there until it provides Motivation for another Reaction</p>
		<p>The <em>Motivation</em> is external and objective and is presented as it would be shown by a video camera, were the character to film the scene themselves. Things seen, felt, and heard could be experienced by any observer in the area, not just the character.</p>
		<p>The <em>Reaction</em> is internal and subjective. Reaction is presented exactly as your character would experience it. The Reaction is more complex than the Motivation because internal processes happen on a different time-scale than external ones; a few seconds can feel like hours. The strict order of responses given is because narration feels more grounded when it follows a logical pattern of mental responses in ascending order of time required to register and execute.</p>
		<p>Reactions usually use only the three generalized response types (Feeling, Action, Speech), but in case a clearer firing order is needed, they're broken down further in the list above. A minimum of only one response is required to constitute a Reaction, and that response may be simply to do nothing, such as watching or thinking.</p>
		<p>Planned Action may be led with a bit of dialogue, assuming that the dialogue isn't expecting a response. Blocks of Speech may be broken up for clarity using small character actions (called "action tags"), as long as those actions aren't demanding a response.</p>
		<p>Exposition can appear in either the Motivation or Reaction and takes place outside of time and space. Exposition generally follows an action, dialogue, or description, and allows the author to pause the story to give the reader more context (setting, summary, backstory), usually in regards to what just occurred. Since Exposition is Telling rather than Showing, it can be used to summarize events quickly, spanning years in a single sentence, at the cost of emotional impact. Signs of Exposition are the inability to break the text into Motivation and Reaction, actions that require time to pass, and the phrases "had," "would have," and "was."</p>
		<p>Don't confuse Thoughts and Inner Monologue with Exposition. Inner Monologue is performed by the character in the here and now, and even though thought happens much faster than action, time still passes while thinking.</p>
		<p>Don't confuse Description with Exposition. Exposition can be everywhere and nowhere, but Description is in the here and now. It is describing exactly what the character sees right now while time moves forward. However, seeing is an internal action and therefore happens far quicker than doing, so a lot of description can happen in a very short amount of time. </p>

		<h2 id="style%20guide">Style Guide</h2>
		<p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>
		<p>Oracle questions, skill check intents, and roll interpretations are given in present tense regardless of perspective (eg. "Does the guard let me pass?").</p>
		<p>Character sheet changes are given using the imperative (eg. "Mark progress and add Bob as a connection").</p>
		<p>Adjustments to a roll are given in simple past tense (eg. "Swarm SFX added d6 to pool and stepped up effect").</p>
		<p>Labels are always in bold.</p>
		<p>References to temporary items on character sheets (threads, aspects, vows, complications, etc) are in italics.</p>
		<p>Numerical adjustments to character sheets should give the new value in parenthesis.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
		<p>Since all oracle questions, skill checks, and character sheet changes come with labels, anything placed on a line without a label is a note to the reader.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm going to set this meeting up as a scene challenge.<br>
		  <strong>Begin the Scene:</strong> Add <em>Convince the Heroes</em> (formidable) as scene objective. Set <em>Tension Clock</em> to 6 segments.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm going to set this meeting up as a scene challenge.<br>
		  <strong>Change:</strong> Begin the Scene: Add Convince the Heroes (formidable) as scene objective. Set Tension Clock to 6 segments.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Binary Questions</strong></p>
		<p>The label can list the type of binary question it is (eg. "Fate Chart"), or simply be labeled as "Oracle."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is the coroner making a phone call? (50/50) Otherwise she steals something. [3] Exceptional yes. It's more than just a business call.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Fate Chart<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Is the coroner making a phone call?<br>
		  <strong>Likelihood:</strong> (50/50)<br>
		  <strong>Alternative:</strong> Otherwise she steals something.<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [3]<br>
		  <strong>Result:</strong> Exceptional yes.<br>
		  <strong>Interpretation:</strong> It's more than just a business call.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Open Questions</strong></p>
		<p>The label can list the exact table that is being rolled on (eg. "Character Action"), be listed as "Meaning" to indicate that it's an open question, or simply be labeled as "Oracle" to lump it with binary questions.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Where are we? [Dark / Cramped] In the basement.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Meaning<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Where are we?<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [Dark / Cramped]<br>
		  <strong>Interpretation:</strong> In the basement.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Oracle Arrays</strong></p>
		<p>These are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Oracle Array:</strong> Where does the meeting with the heroes take place? (1-2: Protectorate HQ, 3-4: The train yard, 5-6: Downtown) [6] It takes place Downtown.</p>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Label:</strong> Oracle Array<br>
		  <strong>Question:</strong> Where does the meeting with the heroes take place?<br>
		  <strong>Array:</strong> (1-2: Protectorate HQ, 3-4: The train yard, 5-6: Downtown)<br>
		  <strong>Roll:</strong> [6]<br>
		  <strong>Result:</strong> It takes place Downtown.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Skill Checks</strong></p>
		<p>Skill checks usually list the acting character for the label, but PbtA games may use the move name instead. Slight adjustments to display of modifiers/dice pool and rolls may be needed for clarity depending on rule system. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Skitter:</strong> I try to summon my swarm. (Bug Controller d8, Devotion d8, Intellect d8, Bug Control d8, d6) [1, 7, 1, 2, 5] = 12 (d10).
