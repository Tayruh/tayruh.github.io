<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>The church was ruined. Pews were tossed and destroyed. The nave was
covered in blood and broken bodies. In the center of this massacre were
a young man and woman.</p>
<p>Vincent stood above Katherine in the destroyed church. She sat
motionless on the pew and stared back up at him. He held out a hand to
her and she just stared at that as well.</p>
<p>"Come," Vincent said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Katherine accept his hand? (Answer,
Cooperation, Aggressiveness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [1, 2, 6] No. She is angry and doesn't want
to follow his lead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She slapped his hand away. "Leave me."</p>
<p>The two stood in silence among the bodies and ruin. Vincent waited
for Katherine to do or say anything, but she outlasted the vampire.</p>
<p>"There isn't time for this, Katherine. You can either walk beside me,
or I'll carry you," he said.</p>
<p>She crossed her arms in a pout. "You'll have to carry me then," the
young girl said in a huff.</p>
<p>Without a moment to waste, Vincent leaned forward and easily scooped
the blonde up into his arms. She let out a yelp of surprise and quickly
slung an arm around his neck for stability. He carried her out of the
church like a newly wed couple crossing the threshold.</p>
<p>He carried her like this down the street. He did his best to stick to
the shadows, primarily out of habit since the streets were nearly empty
and hiding was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Katherine rested her head against his chest. "Where are you taking
me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Someplace safe."</p>
<p>"Safe? I would have been safe in the church, had you not slaughtered
the entire clergy."</p>
<p>"I am not the only one looking for you, Katherine. The church members
wouldn't have been able to protect you."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and sighed. "Clearly not."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I'll protect you and keep you safe."</p>
<p>"The monster whom I just witnessed slaughter my last remaining family
member is now delivering me to an unknown destination. Why should I
worry?"</p>
<p>"You joke, but you do understand that your uncle was a disgusting
creature, right? What I've done is nothing compared to the harm that man
has done this town. That church was diseased."</p>
<p>"My uncle, he.. well.. he didn't lay a hand on me, but I was always
afraid." She shuddered. "I will not miss him."</p>
<p>Vincent remained silent. After a few moments, he pet her hair to
comfort her.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before they appeared before the run down trinket
store. As it was nearing the Christmas holiday, the store was stocked
with seasonal supplies and decorated with signs of the holiday. It was
nearly midnight and the store had long since closed. Vincent let himself
in.</p>
<p>After crossing the threshold with Katherine in his arms, he gently
lowered her to feet. "Follow me," he said and walked toward the back of
the room. He opened a door at the back of the shop and descended a set
of stairs.</p>
<p>Katherine hesitated to follow him. For a moment she considered
running but instead weighed her options. He was fast and would no doubt
catch her, likely before she even left the shop. Additionally, there was
allegedly another group out to get her and she couldn't guarantee that
they would treat her as kindly as Vincent had thus far--murder of
familial members aside.</p>
<p>'Better the devil you know,' she thought to herself and followed
Vincent down the stairs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it as expected? (Yes/And, Straight,
Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 6, 2] What I expected was a den full of
vampires, but instead it's completely vacant. It doesn't appear to be
dangerous though and Vincent's master is still here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Vincent walked down the hallway towards his master's room, it
became apparent that the place was empty. Bedroom doors were left ajar
and the dining area and rest area were vacant. He became suspicious of
whether his master was even here, but he knocked on the door nonetheless
and was invited in by a voice beyond the door.</p>
<p>Vincent entered with Katherine behind his back. He instinctively
shielded her, the state of the den putting his guard up.</p>
<p>The room was empty with the exception of his master who was seated at
her desk.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charlotte</strong> (Vincent's sire)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Killer</li>
<li>Descriptor: Amicable and Amusing</li>
<li>Traits: Lover, not a fighter; Stolid; Stoical</li>
<li>Goals: Take Wealthy; Persecute Success; Distress Servitude</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent and his master have a romantic
history? (Mixed, Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 3, 5] There is dramatic romantic tension
between the two and they may have slept together once or twice but they
are not a couple.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent's master consider him an equal?
(Answer, Curiosity, Cooperation)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [4, 6, 3] Yes and no. She has been
enthralled by him since he first met him as a mortal and has never
wanted him to leave her side, and so she would never treat him like a
lesser being, but at the same time she always makes sure he knows who
wears the pants in the relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Vincent, my sweet. You've returned," Charlotte said. She was leaned
back in her chair with her feet resting on her desk and her hands behind
her head.</p>
<p>"Yes. I have brought the girl as you've requested," he said.</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Charlotte clapped her hands together. "I trust there
were no difficulties?"</p>
<p>"There were complications, but nothing that I couldn't handle."</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and tried to read his face, something that she
always had trouble with. "Are we going to need a cleanup crew?"</p>
<p>He lowered his head. "I'm sorry, Master."</p>
<p>She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. "Quit with that 'master'
nonsense. You know I hate that."</p>
<p>"Yes, M--" he caught himself and repeated, "Yes."</p>
<p>Charlotte just rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Bring the girl here."</p>
<p>Vincent grabbed Katherine's wrist and together they crossed the room
to stand before Charlotte. In the blink of an eye Charlotte had moved
from the prone resting position in her chair to perched at the edge of
her desk.</p>
<p>"Ooh, she's pretty. Not prettier than me, I hope?" Charlotte shot a
sidewise glance at Vincent with a smirk.</p>
<p>"When compared with your beauty, all are like a candle and you are
the sun," Vincent said in a monotone rehearsed manner.</p>
<p>Charlotte playfully pushed his shoulder. "You dork."</p>
<p>Katherine looked back and forth between the two. She was starting to
feel more uncomfortable about their interactions than the fact that she
was standing in a vampire den.</p>
<p>"If I may ask," Vincent began, "where is everyone? Why are we
alone?"</p>
<p>"Are you afraid to be alone with me, Vincent?" Charlotte waggled her
eyebrows in a playfully seductive manner. She was met with Vincent's
blank stare. "Gah. You're no fun." She threw her hands up and pushed
herself off the desk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are they alone?<br />
<strong>Why:</strong> [Connected Bureaucracy] The other members voted
her out, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What'd she do wrong?<br />
<strong>What:</strong> [Lineage of World] They are upset about her
favoring Vincent all of the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She paced around the office. "You want to know why we're alone? They
left me, Vincent. Left <em>us</em>. They're gone and we were discarded
like trash."</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"You, honestly." She looked at Vincent like she could burst into
tears any second. "Or rather, it was my treatment of you. It's no secret
that you're my favorite. The others got tired of my favoritism. They
said"--she dropped into a lower octave and put her hands on her
hips--"'It's either him or us.'" She sighed. "It was never a choice. It
was always going to be you."</p>
<p>"Charlotte... I don't know what to say." Vincent said.</p>
<p>She just shook her head. "There's nothing to say. I'm weak. You make
me weak. But I don't even care. It's better this way."</p>
<p>The room went quiet. Vincent and Charlotte were trapped in their
heads with what-ifs and what-may-have-beens.</p>
<p>Awkwardly, Katherine broke the silence. "Excuse me, but why am I
here?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Select:</strong> She's here because..</p>
<ul>
<li>she possesses a skill (1-2)</li>
<li>she knows something (3-4)</li>
<li><strong>her blood is special (5-7) [5]</strong></li>
<li>she has political importance (8)</li>
<li>she has religious importance (9)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Select:</strong> What is special about her blood?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Aged Bad guy] It can revive someone. (1-3)
[3]</strong></li>
<li>[Attention of Crush] It is addictive. (4)</li>
<li>[Attainment of Catastrophe] It can cure a vampire disease. (5)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Revive who?<br />
<strong>Who:</strong> [Demonically Feisty] Charlotte's sire,
Corinna.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corinna</strong> (Charlotte's sire)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Witch</li>
<li>Descriptor: Plucky and Unassuming</li>
<li>Other Traits: Traitorous; Involved; Guileless</li>
<li>Goals: Win affection; Shepherd Lust; Strive Pleasure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte tell her why she's here? (Answer,
Motivation, Directness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [3, 3, 6] She tells Katherine why she's
needed but omits how she's needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You," Charlotte said as she spun to face Katherine with a grin, "are
going to help me wake my sire! I'm so excited!"</p>
<p>"I'm what?"</p>
<p>Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Wake Corinna? But she was sealed away for
being a traitor, wasn't she?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did Charlotte ever tell Vincent the story of
Corinna? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Sympathy)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 2, 3] She did, but she only gave the vaguest
of details, so Vincent has a difficult time understanding what Charlotte
is thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"It's complicated. I know you've mostly heard only rumors, but you'll
have to trust me."</p>
<p>"Of course I trust you," Vincent said without missing a beat.</p>
<p>"Then you have nothing to worry about," Charlotte said with a large
grin. "This is going to be great!"</p>
<p>"But Master, why revive her now?"</p>
<p>She leaned back against her desk. "Well, I originally requested that
you retrieve this girl so that I could revive--or perhaps only threaten
to revive--Corinna for leverage. I could feel the tide turning against
us, so I decided to use my trump card." She shrugged with an exasperated
smile. "But I guess it's too late for that. I misjudged how eager they
were to abandon us."</p>
<p>"Okay, but if the opportunity has passed, then why still revive
her?"</p>
<p>"This place is a dump, Vincent. Don't you agree? This dingy basement
below a Christmas shoppe."</p>
<p>Vincent looked around the room and shrugged. He had taken residence
in places much worse than this.</p>
<p>"It's a dump," Charlotte reaffirmed. "I want out. If we no longer
have to concern ourselves with a coven then there is no reason to stay
here. We can return to traveling the world again. Remember how life used
to be? Just you and I with nothing to hold us down."</p>
<p>He nodded. He did remember and had fond memories of those times. "And
Corinna?"</p>
<p>"I can't leave her, Vincent." She sighed. "I could accept her being
sealed when she was just right over there," she waved her arm
haphazardly in the directly of the other coven, "but I can't leave town
with her like that. I can't abandon her, regardless of what the charges
are against her."</p>
<p>"A jailbreak then?" he asked.</p>
<p>She gave a devilish grin. "A jailbreak."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is Katherine accepting all of this? (Answer,
Curiosity, Cooperation)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [6, 2, 1] She is okay with going along with
what they're suggesting since she basically has nothing else now, but
she also doesn't have any personal interest in what Charlotte wants and
doesn't intend to be proactive at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katherine sat in Charlotte's desk chair. "That all sounds great. I
hope you enjoy yourselves. I'll be waiting here until you get back."</p>
<p>Charlotte chuckled. "You silly girl, you're coming with us. We need
you on site to revive Corinna. Not to mention that you'll undoubtedly
run the moment you leave our sight."</p>
<p>Katherine frowned. The thought had obviously crossed her mind, but
where would she even go?</p>
<p>"Should we attack tonight?" Vincent asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should they? (Answer, Motivation,
Directness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [2, 2, 5] Nope. Charlotte isn't in the
mood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte sighed in such a manner that she resembled a deflating
balloon. "Not tonight, please. It's been a trying night and Corinna can
stand to hibernate one more day. Tonight I want cuddles."</p>
<p>"Cuddles," Vincent repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes! With the coven gone, I no longer need to pretend that you are
just another clan member. I apparently wasn't very good at hiding it
anyway, but now I can dote on you to my heart's content. And so:
cuddles." She grinned at Vincent like a child on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>"I see. Cuddles it is then."</p>
<p>Katherine rose from her seat. "Right, well, have fun. It's after
midnight and I'm going to sleep."</p>
<p>"I don't think so, Missy," Charlotte said with her hands on her hips.
"You're staying up with us. We can't have you passing out from sleep
deprivation in the middle of our raid tomorrow. You'll sleep when we do
to sync your schedule."</p>
<p>She groaned. "Fine. But can you at least start a fire? It's freezing
in here and I'm not cold blooded like you are."</p>
<p>And so the three of them passed the night away in front of the
fireplace, which was actually the boiler in the basement. Vincent and
Charlotte sat on a couch, Charlotte draped herself all over Vincent, and
they conversed all night.</p>
<p>Katherine sat in a separate chair and keep quiet. Every time she
began to nod off, Charlotte poked her cheek with her finger.</p>
<p>Eventually the sun rose, at which time Charlotte sealed Katherine
away in a storage room furnished with a cot. Charlotte returned to her
bedroom, dragging Vincent with her. She snuggled up to Vincent as they
drifted off to sleep in her bed.</p>
