# Fate

## Skills

> **Telepathy:** Telepathy can be used to read minds, transfer thoughts, alter memories or thoughts, or psionic attack. It can be defended against using Telepathy or Will.
> 
> **Telekinesis:** Telekinesis is used to manipulate objects not held by the user. It can be used to defend against Fight and Shoot. You can defend against Telekinesis using Telekinesis, and in the case of yourself being moved with Telekinesis, Physique.
> 
> **Magic:** Magic is a catch-all skill for anything involving mystical energies. Most commonly it is used to create something out of nothing similar to the Craft skill, but it may also be used to attack directly using energy similar to Shoot. You can defend against Magic using Magic, or in some cases, Telekinesis.

> **Relationship:** Proud Mother of the Stepford Cuckoos
> **Other:** Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend
> 
> **Situation:** Boost (read Madelyne's thoughts)
> 
> ==SKILLS==
> **+4:** Telepathy
> **+3:** Resources, Will
> **+2:** Deceive, Fight, Provoke

> **Physical:** 0/3 • **Mental:** 0/6
> **2: Mild:**
> **4: Moderate:**
> **6: Severe:**
> **Fate Points:** 2/2

> ==STUNTS==
> **Mental Manipulation:** Because she is gifted in manipulating the thoughts of others, Emma gets +2 and an additional free invoke on success when using Telepathy to create an advantage by making others believe what she wants. `(2)`
> 
> **Diamond Form:** Because her diamond form is nearly impervious, while in this form, Emma gets armor:4 when using Fight to defend against physical attacks and weapon:2 when using Fight with strength-based attacks. Her diamond form also prevents the use of her Telepathy skill, reducing refresh cost by 2. `(1)`
> 
> **Vast Network:** Because she always knows someone who is able and willing to get her what she wants, Emma can conjure up a convenient connection out of the blue for free once per scene.

> ==PERMISSIONS==
> **Telepathy:** Using her telepathic powers, Emma can transmit thoughts, read thoughts and memories, alter and erase memories, alter emotions, cause visions, and create mental feedback (such as a mind blast).
> 
> **[Diamond Form](images/emma%20frost/emma%20(11).png):** While in this form, Emma is completely resistant to psychic powers of any kind. She is not able to perform them nor have them performed on her, including standard telepathy. She also has super strength, has limitless stamina, doesn't require oxygen, and doesn't feel emotion. Emma can make the change to diamond form so quickly that she may use it to react to gunshots at close range.
> 
> **Resources:** Emma and her connections has been one of the best things to happen to the X-Men, especially with Xavier's wishy-washy standings with the government and society as of late. She basically finances the X-Men at this point.

> 
> **Hypnotic Charm:** Because his voice gives him persuasive influence over others, Gambit gets +2 when using Rapport to overcome by convincing someone with his charm.
>

> ==PERMISSIONS==

<br>

## Magik

![illyana (0)](./images/magik/illyana%20(0).png)

> Illyana Rasputin
> 
> ==ASPECTS==
> **High Concept:** Scary Teleporting Sorceress
> **Trouble:** Demon Queen of Limbo
> **Relationship:** Kitty Is My Best Friend
> **Other:** Darkchylde is Always Just Beneath the Surface
> 
> ==SKILLS==
> **+4:** Magic
> **+3:** Athletics, Fight
> **+2:** Provoke, Resources (Limbo), Will
> **+1:** Lore, Notice, Physique, Stealth

> ==VITALS==
> **Physical:** 0/4 • **Mental:** 0/4
> **2: Mild:**
> **4: Moderate:**
> **6: Severe:**
> **Fate Points:** 2/2

> ==STUNTS==
> **Stepping Disc:** Because she can use her portals as part of her fighting style, while using her portals, Illyana gets +2 when using Athletics to defend or Fight to attack. `(2)`
> 
> **Limbo Blast:** Because she can fire large blasts of energy from Limbo using the stepping disc portals, Illyana gets +1 per target when using Magic to attack with blasts from her portals and splits the shifts among multiple targets.
> 
> **Soulsword:** Because it is a piece of her soul, Illyana gets weapon:2 when using Fight to attack magical entities with the Soulsword.

> ==PERMISSIONS==
> **[Stepping Disc](./images/magik/illyana%20(16).jpg):** Illyana's stepping disc portal can remain open as long as she wants and has been seen to grow large enough to swallow the X-Mansion. The portal opens quickly enough that she can use it as a means of dodging and countering in combat. While Illyana has been known to travel as far as the other side of the globe, traveling so far puts a strain on her ability and she runs the risk of arriving in the wrong place or even the wrong time. Illyana must always travel to Limbo as the final stop before her destination.
> 
> **Soulsword:** Illyana's sword is formed from a piece of her soul and anyone in possession of the Soulsword is granted basic access to Illyana's abilities—namely magic and creating stepping discs. The Soulsword is not physically real, and therefore can only harm magical creatures.
> 
> **Eldritch Armor:** Illyana can summon armor through magic, not unlike her brother Collosus's mutant ability. It also grants her increased strength.
> 
> **Demon Queen:** Illyana is the ruler of Limbo and can summon demons via her stepping disc to fight by her side.
> 
> **[Darkchylde](./images/magik/illyana%20(15).jpg):** When Illyana is overcome with emotions such as anger, she "hulks out" and becomes Darkchylde, which is the form of the demon queen of Limbo. She has difficulty maintaining control over her mind and emotions in this form and basically becomes another personality, usually attacking her allies. While in this form, she denies any attempts of telepathic probing used against her. Illyana will revert to normal when rendered unconscious.

> **Super Strength:** Because she has enhanced strength, Rogue gets weapon:2 when using Fight with strength-based attacks.
> 
> **Super Durability:** Because she has enhanced durability, Rogue gets armor:4 when using Athletics to defend against physical attacks. `(2)`
> 
> **Power Absorbsion:** Because she has the ability of power absorbsion, when Rogue is in skin contact with the target and uses Physique to create an advantage, she may spend a fate point to give them a *stolen power* aspect on success, granting her access to their power (plus related stunts and skills) for the scene.

> ==PERMISSIONS==
> **Flight:** Rogue is able to fly by willing herself to. She does not use an external force like telekinesis.
> 
> **Touch:** Rogue mostly has control over her energy drain power activating by touch these days, but it can accidentally be triggered when she's scared.

> ==STUNTS==

> 
> **Claws:** Because he has adamantium claws, Logan gets weapon:4 when using Fight to attack with his claws. `(2)`
> 
> **Unkillable:** Because his body regenerates at superhuman speed, Logan may spend a fate point to downgrade the severity of all physical consequences by 1; severe becomes moderate, moderate becomes mild, and mild is removed. Downgraded consequences may share the same slot with an existing mental consequence.

> ==PERMISSIONS==
> **Adamantium Skeleton:** Logan has an indestructible skeleton, thanks to its adamantium coating. His claws are made of bone but they are coated as well, granting him the ability to cut through nearly anything.
> 
> **Regeneration:** Logan has an incredible healing ability and can recover from wounds such as being disemboweled in just a few moments. In the past he's been blown atoms by a nuclear bomb and regenerated in less than an hour.
