		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Angry d6</em>. Remove <em>Caked d8</em> complication. She got cleaned up.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Remove <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication. Her nap sobered her up.<br>
		  <strong>Cami:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Insecure d8</em>. Remove <em>Ashamed d6</em> complication. She escaped to her room to center herself.</p>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d8, Insecurity d8) [3, 8, 3] = 11 (d8)<br>
		  <strong>Jess:</strong> While we're gone, she attempts to soothe Cami's insecurity. (Yandere d8, Cami d10, Presence d6, Treat d8) [5, 1, 1, 2] =  7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		   <strong>Cami:</strong> Take <em>Insecure d12</em> stress and gain a PP (2) from 2 hitches. Jess tries to convince Cami that she should stop worrying about me because I'm a human and I don't matter, but highlighting the differences between us only makes Cami even more upset.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Seoyun, Finola, and I head into town to hit the local grocery store. [1] Altered Scene. [Actions: Conceal Balance] Someone or something is off-balance?<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have difficulty hiding her tails? (50/50) [67] No.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is Finola still drunk? (50/50) [14] Yes. I thought it'd be out of her system after her nap, but nope.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Take <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication.</p>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Halloween is soon. Is it today? (50/50) [23] Yes. It's Halloween night right now.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Are the streets crowded? (Likely) [69] No. Surprisingly, the streets are not full of trick-or-treaters at the moment.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>After helping Finola get cleaned up, I ventured to Seoyun's room on the second floor, with the little faerie cradled in my hands since she had still not sobered. I knocked on the door and it opened a moment later.</p>
		<p>Seoyun stood in the doorway, one arm braced against the frame like she were posing for a photo shoot. She greeted me with a vulpine smile and glittering amber eyes. "Seth."</p>
		<p>The sheer weight of the sensuality dripping from her voice resonated within me, and I instinctually felt the need to either throw myself at her or run for the hills. Instead, I held Finola closer to me and straightened my back.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Seoyun. I need to head into town to pick up some snack supplies for our celebration, and I thought that if you wanted to stretch your legs some, I could really use your help," I suggested.</p>
		<p>Seoyun tilted her head forward, her eyes never leaving mine, and her long wavy auburn hair flowed around her face to frame her features perfectly, like she had practiced the maneuver hundreds of times, which she may have.</p>
		<p>"A road trip. Just you and I?" she practically purred, her fox ears twitching in excitement.</p>
		<p>I cleared my throat, and nodded toward Finola. "And this little troublemaker."</p>
		<p>Seoyun's eyes narrowed and she pulled back, crinkling her nose as though I were holding a bundle of sweaty gym socks rather than an adorable but intoxicated little girl. "Bah. Finola? I'll have to think about it."</p>
		<p>"Please?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have a condition for agreeing to help me? (50/50) [47] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Actions: Ambush Exterior] She wants to hunt.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Her eyes flicked back and forth between the faerie and me as she debated. Finally she huffed and said, "Fine, but I have a condition."</p>
		<p>"What is it?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun flipped her hair over her shoulder in a motion reminiscent of Cami. "If you're getting snacks, I want a snack, too. It's been far too long since I've hunted."</p>
		<p>I frowned while I considered the implications. Seoyun was a kumiho, also known as a nine-tailed fox spirit, and as such, she needed to feed off the spirit energy of humans to sustain herself. Obviously I didn't want anyone hurt, but I also couldn't deny a guest sustinence, and furthermore, anything that happened outside the grounds of the boarding house was technically no longer our responsibility.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." I sighed, dropping my shoulders a fraction. "Yeah, okay. Just be careful."</p>
		<p>Seoyun darted forward and planted a kiss on my cheek before I could respond.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, sweetie," she crooned, then quickly disappeared down the hallway toward the stairs, two large and fluffy fox tails trailing behind her.</p>
		<p>From my hands, I heard Finola singing, "Seoyun and Seth, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G."</p>
		<p>I hung my head and groaned, causing the little girl to break down into a fit of giggles.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything happen on the way into town? (Unlikely) [3] Exceptional yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What happens? [Actions: Free Elements] It begins downpouring.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Moments later, the kumiho and I got into my sporty hatchback and headed into town.</p>
		<p>The dirt road leading into the town of Forest Glen was a long and winding, framed by thick barriers of trees on both sides. The surrounding forest went on as far as the eye could see, rising along the hills that encircled the town, and gave the distinct feeling that the town and the boarding house were cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
		<p>Night was fully upon us and the rain was falling in sheets. The downpour blocked out the moonlight and turned the dirt road into muddy slop. It was probably insane for me to drive in these conditions, but I was determined to make this anniversary celebration a success, and for that we needed party supplies.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d6, Downpour d10) [2, 1,5] = 7 (d4)<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> I try driving safely through the night rain. (Housemaster d8, Seoyun d8, Awareness d6, Drive d6) [1, 1, 4, 3] = 7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Bargain Tactic] My mistake gives Seoyun something to hold over my head later.<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> Take <em>Insecure d4</em> stress. Take <em>Guilt Material d8</em> complication and gain a PP (2) from hitches. I'm frustrated at my inability to keep my guest safe, but Seoyun finds it hilarious and will probably use it against me.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is Seoyun discussing? [Character Conversations: Praise / Quiet] She's going off about how brave I am. Who knows if she's being serious or not.</p>
