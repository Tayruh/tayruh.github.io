## What is this?
- This is the framework that I use for solo roleplaying. It's taken me a while to define a cohesive procedure for myself that just "flows" when I play and this is the result.
- The purpose of this outline is to document this procedure for myself, but also share it with the public in the hopes that it may help others struggling with the same issues that I had when starting.

## Systems

### Emulator
These are what I use for answering questions.
- Oracle from **[Motif Story Engine](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/316073)** for questions about the story (GM targeted questions).
- Oracle from **[Motif Character Engine](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/328769)** for questions about character actions (player targeted questions).
- **[Commonsense](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/359829)** for picking an item from a list of possible outcomes using a combination of logic and chance.
- Meaning tables from **[Mythic Magazine Vol.18](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/398423)** as a muse for answering open questions and describing scenes. Any word table will do, as long as it has Adverbs, Adjectives, Verbs, and Nouns. MM Vol.18 just has a lot of useful tables all in one spot.	

### Rules & Tools
These are the tools that I use alongside the emulator to run my adventure.
- **[The 9Qs](https://battreps.blogspot.com/2014/05/9q-solo-rpg-engine-2013-edition-reposted.html)** for forcing a story structure on scenes and threads.
- Randomized Location Crafter from **[Mythic Magazine Vol.2](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/345652)** for exploring areas in a roguelike manner.
- **[Cortex Prime](https://www.cortexrpg.com)** as a generic rule system. It can be as simple as representing a character with a single die or can scale up to be a deep and intricate system customized to suit the theme of the world and flavor or your game.


## Running the Adventure
This is how I answer questions and generally run my game.

### Formatting

For clarity, I like to format it like the following:
- Since I tend to use markdown for note keeping, I wrap all non-story text (like oracles and skill checks and other rule system stuff) in blockquotes.
- I label the question line with "Q" and follow it with the actual question. 
- Modifiers to the oracle or dice (such as flavor, dice modifiers, or difficulty levels) are wrapped in parenthesis and follow the question.
- The answer line is labeled using the oracle source or skill check name (like "Story" for the Motif Story Engine, "Action" for Mythic Actions Meaning table, "Navigation ", "Starship Gunnery" for Star Wars gunnery check, etc).
- Dice rolls or oracle results are wrapped in square brackets and follow the label of the answer line.
- My interpretation of the results follow the square bracketed results.

### Binary Story Questions
- I answer Yes or No questions using the oracle from **Motif Story Engine**. This simulates asking the GM a question. 
- The extra Flavor of the roll helps answer a second related question at the same time, or put the answer in a context using the result of the Flavor question. This helps avoid the problem with most binary oracles where the Yes or No result leaves you hanging on what that actually means to the story.

> **Q:** Did Charlotte ever tell Vincent the story of Corinna? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Sympathy)  
> **Story:** \[5, 2, 3] She did, but she only gave the vaguest of details, so Vincent has a difficult time understanding what Charlotte is thinking.


### Character Questions
- I answer questions regarding character interaction using the oracle from **Motif Character Engine**. This simulates asking a player a question.
- While it can give you a Yes or No, the answer is more about how the character responds to something, so it should be interpreted more like Agree or Disagree than Yes or No, and often results in a Maybe. This coupled with using two different Flavors gives you a complex answer to a question.

> **Q:** Is Katherine accepting all of this? (Answer, Curiosity, Cooperation)  
> **Character:** \[6, 2, 1] She is okay with going along with what they're suggesting since she basically has nothing else now, but she also doesn't have any personal interest in what Charlotte wants and doesn't intend to be proactive at all.

- You can also replace the Answer die with another Flavor so that the answer only describes their mood rather than whether they're in agreement.

> **Q:** How does Katherine feel towards Vincent? (Curiosity, Aggressiveness, Cooperation)  
> **Character:** \[2, 4, 4] She doesn't really care that he's a vampire. She's fairly cooperative but she also snaps back whenever she feels insulted or threatened. 

### Open-Ended Questions
- I use word tables to answer open-ended questions. I generally stick with the Meaning tables from **Mythic Magazine Vol.18**, although I occasionally use tables from other sources.
- The following are some additional uses of word tables:
	- Descriptions from Mythic can be broken down into Adverb and Adjective. Actions from Mythic can be broken down into Verb and Noun. 
	- The 9Qs: 
		- *Conflict, Rise, Refocus:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *Catalyst, Twist, Revelation, Fall, Resolution:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *Showdown:* Adverb Adjective / Adjective Noun
	- Standard 5W+H questions:
		- *Who, Where:* Adverb Adjective / Adjective Noun
		-  *What, When, Why:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
		- *How:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
	- *Action/Event:* Verb Noun
	- *Topic/Theme:* Noun of Noun
	- NPCs:
		- *Identity:* Noun
		- *Descriptor, Trait:* Adjective
		- *Goal:* Verb Noun

> **Q:** Why are they alone?  
> **Why:** \[Connected Bureaucracy] The other members voted her out, basically.

- Sometimes I need more than one oracle result to zero in on an answer. I combine them together for the meaning.

> **Q:** Where is the vampire coven?   
> **What:** \[Secretively Evasive; Festively Cruel] It tends to move around, but it's currently based under a holiday themed shop. It's nearly Christmas so that's the current theme.

### Multiple Choice
- I use the concept behind **Commonsense** for multiple choice. However, I often don't concern myself with justifying the reasons as the rules are written, and instead weight each option with a value between 1 and 3 on a scale of how likely I feel it would be, or how much I would like it to happen.
- For the formatting, I write the required dice result in parenthesis following each option. After rolling against the options, I write the rolled result in square brackets following the winning option. I also like to highlight the winning option in bold for clarity.

> **Select:** She's here because..
> - she possesses a skill (1-2)
> - she knows something (3-4)
> - **her blood is special (5-7) \[5]**
> - she has political importance (8)
> - she has religious importance (9)

- Sometimes I really don't know what to do with the story, so I roll up a bunch of answers using the word table, assign an interpreted meaning to each, and then assign the dice values as per usual.

> **Select:** What is special about her blood?
> - **\[Aged Bad guy] It can revive someone. (1-3) \[3]**
> - \[Attention of Crush] It is addictive. (4)
> - \[Attainment of Catastrophe] It can cure a vampire disease. (5)

### Character Creation
- Characters need four things: an identity, a descriptor, traits, and goals:
	- *Identity:* Their archetype in the story. (Witch, Soldier, Shopkeeper, etc). Assign 1 or 2 Nouns.  Feel free to reinterpret the Nouns to describe an archetype that makes sense (ie. "Legal" could be "Police Officer" or "Technology" as "Hacker").
	- *Descriptor:* Who they are at a glance. This is their defining character trait. Assign 1 or 2 Adjectives.
	- *Traits:* These are more traits, but they're subtle and used to add depth to the character. Assign 3 Adjectives.
	- *Goals:* These are the goals which the character would like to accomplish. They're not necessarily written in stone, but they're what the character is generally aiming for, even if it's not something that they may expect to see to the end. Their decisions will be directly affected by these. Assign 3 Verb Noun combinations.
- Like open-ended questions, generally any word table will do. However, the ones provided in **Mythic Magazine Vol.18** or **[UNE (Universal NPC Emulator)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163)** work very well. Additionally, some systems like **[Ironsworn](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/238369)** provide more explicit character motivations that you can mix in with the word table generated ones.

> - **Charlotte** (Vincent's sire)
> 	- *Identity:* Killer
> 	- *Descriptor:* Amicable and Amusing
> 	- *Traits:* Loving; Stolid; Stoical
> 	- *Goals:* Take Wealthy; Persecute Success; Distress Servitude

### Story Structure
- The questions in **The 9Qs** are the basic framework for the standard three-act story structure condensed into story steps. I've labeled the story steps as: *Conflict*, *Catalyst*, *Twist*, *Rise*, *Revelation*, *Fall*, *Refocus*, *Showdown*, and *Resolution*. I turn these story steps into random events that I trigger in order to keep the story flowing. 
- Because stories are fractal, the 9Qs can help shape a scene, an event, an arc, or an entire campaign using the same structure and methods. 
- Generally when I play, I don't strictly adhere to the structure step by step as I go. Instead, when the story lulls, I look back over my story so far and determine which story questions have already been answered. I then check the word table to create an event for the next one in line. 
- The story steps can be answered using the word table like this:
	1. *Conflict:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun, 
	2. *Catalyst:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
	3. *Twist:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
	4. *Rise:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
	5. *Revelation:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
	6. *Fall:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun
	7. *Refocus:* Verb Noun / Noun of Noun
	8. *Showdown:* Adverb Adjective / Adjective Noun
	9. *Resolution:* Adjective Noun / Noun of Noun



## Note Keeping

### Formatting
This is how I lay out my story summary page.
- **Summary:** The initial story summary, which is about a paragraph.
- **Anticipations:** A list for tracking concepts or events that you want to see manifest in the game/story and is the primary reason that you are playing. This list should always have at least one incomplete item that you are working toward. I cross them out as they get fulfilled.
- **Notes:** A list of notes to yourself about the game, like questions or potential problems that you need to figure out, or reminders to do things. I cross them out rather than deleting them once they no longer matter.
- **Threads:** A nested list of storylines currently happening in the game, described by important events and labeled by their associated 9Qs story sections to help form a narrative arc.
- **Character List** and **Thread List:** Lists as described in *[Mythic GME](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798)* for randomly selecting the story elements of your game when needed, but using the Adventure List version from *Mythic 2e* as described in *[Mythic Magazine Vol.17](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/395373)*. 
- **Characters:** The character sheets and summaries of PCs and NPCs. This section is sometimes extracted into a separate file if it gets too large.   
	After generating a PC or NPC using the method described in the Meaning table section, I then write a short interpreted summary of that character (only a few sentences). The character's character sheet follows that.

### Example
The following is an example of my summary file.

> ## Summary
