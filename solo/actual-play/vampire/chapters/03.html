</blockquote>
<p>The group returned to their base below the Christmas shoppe and
congregated in the rest area with the couch and boiler. Vincent stood
guard just outside the room while Charlotte collapses lazily on the
couch across from the boiler. Corinna paced angrily back and forth,
consumed in thought.</p>
<p>Katherine watched Corinna with a worried expression. "Am I...allowed
to go now? I did what you needed, didn't I?"</p>
<p>Corinna stopped pacing. "Oh no. We have more uses for you, girl."</p>
<p>"What? But I thought--" Katherine froze mid-sentence when Corinna
appeared before her in the time it took for her to blink.</p>
<p>"Your blood is special. Very special," Corinna said as she lightly
traced a line down Katherine's neck with her fingernail. "As Vanessa's
descendant, you are the antithesis to her powers. Her blood magic, her
compulsion; all of it can be negated with your blood."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Kat," Charlotte said from the couch.</p>
<p>Margaret shook her head. "Why do you even care about Vanessa? You're
free now. Just let it go."</p>
<p>"You!" Corinna spun toward Margaret. "This is all because of
<em>you!</em>" She slammed Margaret against the wall and held her there
with a hand against her chest. "Are you ready to die?"</p>
<p>Margaret glared at her. "Go ahead."</p>
<p>Corinna reared back her other hand. Her nails glinted in the light
like knives. "Why did you do it?" she asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did Margaret betray Corinna?<br />
<strong>Why:</strong> [Paying Attention] She felt unappreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret never broke her stare but didn't say a word. The onlookers
were frozen, unsure whether they had the right or the desire to get
involved.</p>
<p>"Nothing to say for yourself, human?" Corinna growled.</p>
<p>Margaret looked away. "That's right. I'm just a worthless human. Just
a plaything for vampires whenever it suits your whimsy and tossed aside
when it doesn't."</p>
<p>"What are prattling on about, woman?" the small vampire asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was it Corinna that betrayed Margaret in the
past? (Yes/And, Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [4, 6, 3] She definitely did, but she wasn't
aware that she did so.<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> How did she betray her?<br />
<strong>How:</strong> [Prohibit Mundane] She created her vampire coven
and excluded humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret snapped her head back toward Corinna. "You don't remember
tossing me out like trash?"</p>
<p>Margaret glared like she could bore a hole through Corinna with her
eyes. When Corinna didn't respond, she continued, "You and Charlotte
were all that I had left as a child after my family died from disease.
You gave me a home and we became a family. But that wasn't enough, was
it? You needed to be a queen with your own coven. A coven that no longer
needed a human."</p>
<p>"You're a grown woman. You can manage," Charlotte said from the
couch.</p>
<p>"You were my family!" Margaret shouted at her. "My home was with
you... and you took that away from me."</p>
<p>"Then you feel justified in having sealed me away for decades?"
Corinna asked, her voice full of anger.</p>
<p>"That wasn't supposed to happen. Vanessa... she double crossed me.
Your confinement was the concession that she made after much bargaining.
She wanted you dead."</p>
<p>"And what did <em>you</em> want? Revenge?" Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>"No!" Margaret shut her eyes tight. "No, I just wanted my family
back. Vanessa promised to disband your coven. And she did. She removed
Corinna as the head and stole the coven right out from under her." She
sighed in frustration. "But what good was that? She captured Corinna and
marked me as a traitor to you all. Along with disbanding your coven, she
disbanded my family."</p>
<p>The room was quiet with no one quite sure what to say. Corinna
released Margaret but remained standing before her.</p>
<p>"Ive been trying to free you," Margaret said looking at Corinna. "The
binding spell was very specific. It was tied to her blood. No one could
break the spell without it, or so I thought," she quickly glanced at
Katherine, "but God did I try. I would cast blood magic until I thought
I was going to pass out from anemia."</p>
<p>"Hmmph," was all Corinna said in response. She crossed her arms and
looked up at the tall red-head. After a long while she said, "You may
stay for now."</p>
<p>Charlotte sat up straight. "Are you sure? I don't tru--"</p>
<p>"I said she stays, Charlotte," Corinna snapped. Charlotte clamped her
mouth shut like a chastised child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Catalyst?</strong> [Guarding Innocence] Vincent vows to
protect Katherine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Is this my life now? Am I to become this woman?" Katherine asks,
gesturing toward Margaret.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, girl," Margaret shot back.</p>
<p>"Your life is your own, Katherine," Vincent said from the
doorway.</p>
<p>"Is it though? You alone dragged me from my home, as miserable as it
was, and now I'm held as a prisoner here for whatever this little girl's
plans are."</p>
<p>Corinna bristled. "I told you that I'm not a little girl."</p>
<p>Katherine dismissed her with a wave of her hand. Corinna scoffed.</p>
<p>"I vowed that I would protect you. I intend to keep that promise,"
Vincent said.</p>
<p>Charlotte stood up. "Protect <em>her</em>? She's just a blood
bag!"</p>
<p>"Don't be jealous, Charlotte. It's unseemly," Margaret said with a
smirk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Twist?</strong> [Cold Agreement; Striving Omen; Danger of
Spirit] Corinna agrees to assign Vincent as Katherine's bodyguard.
Margaret explains the prophecy. The prophecy describes danger for
Katherine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corinna nodded. "This is good. Vincent shall be her bodyguard."</p>
<p>Charlotte gasped. "But Corinna..!"</p>
<p>Corinna rolled her eyes. "Margaret was right. This is unbecoming.
Control yourself."</p>
<p>Charlotte pouted.</p>
<p>Margaret stroked her chin in thought. "This is strange, however.
There was a prophecy once presented to Vanessa. In it, her kine was to
be the death of her. We didn't know what that meant at the time, but..."
She turned to Katherine. "How did your parents die?"</p>
<p>"In a fire..," She responded.</p>
<p>"I see. Yes, that is classic Vanessa. I have no doubt that she knew
of your family. I don't believe that she intended for you to
survive."</p>
<p>"I nearly didn't!" Katherine said wide-eyed. "But you're saying that
she is the one that killed my family? <em>She</em> destroyed my
life?!"</p>
<p>Margaret nodded.</p>
<p>"That bitch!" Katherine turned to Corinna with a look of rage. "I
will help you. She has to die."</p>
<p>Corinna clapped her hands. "Excellent!"</p>
<p>Margaret holds up a hand. "There was more to the prophecy than just
Vanessa's death. The kine will die as well."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is Katherine still okay with this? (Answer,
Motivation, Directness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [6, 5, 6] She is dead set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I don't care! I have nothing now. If I have to die to stop her, then
so be it," Katherine said.</p>
<p>Vincent put a hand on her shoulder. "I won't let you die."</p>
<p>Katherine smiled sadly. "We'll see."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rise?</strong> [Address Intuition; Insult Nobility; Loot
Connection] They create plans based on Vanessa's knowledge of Corinna's
escape, Margaret's betrayal, and the insult to her power that both
present. They will use the Margaret's knowledge of the coven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I, for one, do not believe in prophetic nonsense, and so I do not
think it will come to that," Corinna said. "Regardless, Vanessa will
die. <em>That</em> will come to pass."</p>
<p>"I've never encountered her before. Is Vanessa really that strong?"
Vincent asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is she? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 4, 5] Not powerful, but she's tricky and
surrounds herself with reinforcements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corinna laughed. "Hardly. Despite her age, Vanessa would be no match
for you or Charlotte. No, what makes Vanessa dangerous is her guile.
She's a cunning temptress who speaks with eloquence and knows exactly
what you want to hear." She gave a sideways glance at Margaret who
lowered her head in disgrace. "She has amassed an army with this
ability."</p>
<p>"What's the plan then?" Charlotte asked. She was now sitting
backwards atop the couch to face the conversation taking place behind
it.</p>
<p>Corinna turned to Margaret. "You know her best. Would it be more
prudent to attack her head on or wait for her strike?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should they attack her directly? (Yes/And,
Straight, Favorability)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [1, 1, 3; Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the
player character(s) and/or their interests.] No, and Vanessa will
definitely come for Katherine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret shoke her head. "Attacking her directly would not be a good
idea. Vanessa rarely falls for the same trick twice. Last time she
wasn't expecting you to free Corinna or else she would have left her
guarded. This time she'll be expecting you and will likely have
increased defenses around the castle."</p>
<p>"So, then...," Vincent prodded.</p>
<p>"So then we wait. Here. Vanessa knows that Katherine is a threat,
especially now that she was able to nullify her binding spell on
Corinna. She will come for her. Trust me."</p>
<p>Katherine shrugged and sighed. "It looks like I'm to be bait as well
as a blood bag."</p>
<p>Margaret gave her a sympathetic smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, it appears so." Corinna said. Ignoring Katherine's plight, she
instead analyzed her surroundings. "This place will serve adequately as
a stronghold. You have done well, Charlotte."</p>
<p>Charlotte blinked. "Oh. Uh, thank you," she said, clearly taken off
guard by the compliment regarding the housing that she found at random
in a moment of desperation.</p>
<p>Corinna leaned against the wall. "Now we wait for them to come to
us."</p>
