> Detective Enkidu is an experienced police officer and a Hard-Boiled Detective of Miller’s Square’s Precinct 23. For the past few months she has been secretly moonlighting with “All-Seeing Eye Investigations”, trying to get to the bottom of cold cases deemed ‘unworthy’ by her superiors, and re-opening ones that were suspiciously closed due to ‘lack of evidence’. Enkidu believes that a badge and a gun are all a cop needs. People may betray you, but well-maintained Standard Issue Gear can always be trusted. Despite her stone-cold exterior, she harbors inside her a creature of the Wild from Sumerian myth, who pushes her to break the very rules she fights to protect.
> 
> “Ever since I was a child on the streets, this urge, it was calling me to rip through all this ‘modern woman’ crap and just surrender to the wild, become a beast. When I answer that call, this facade of normality is not the only thing I tear through - so you better not get in my way…”

True, she was born to a Wealthy and Dysfunctional Family if there ever was one, but as a secret Activist for Social Change, she has her own plans for the City: plans that became possible when she found a silver bracelet which turned out to be The Ultimate Weapon in disguise.
> 
> “If you want to do good in the world, the first thing you need to worry about is power. That’s right, you heard me correctly. So, if you care about this City, if you want to be able to change things for the better, you need to be able to exert some influence on those who benefit from the status-quo.”

The powers given to her by the Hood help her track and hunt down those who would harm the young and innocent. This teenage Wall-Flower's harmless appearance and dislike for the spotlight give her the edge she needs to pounce on her prey and deal a deadly blow when least expected. Despite her Innocuous Appearance Scarlet is a natural hunter and as deadly as they come.
> 
> “When Jill got kidnapped, I thought I would lose myself - instead, I found myself - or did it find me? With this Hood, I became the hunter. We’re now a thing, the Hood and me - oh, and Jill and me, of course! I only hope Jill never, ever finds out how terrible, how… dangerous, I can become.”

## Crew

> **Masked Vigilante Investigations** 
> "Wherever the law fails to stop crime, we need to step in."
> *You all agree on one thing the wrongs you've seen cannot be allowed to continue. Whether you met in a street fight or while doing some detective work, you probably have at least one successful team. Investigation under your belt, such as
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bringing a serial criminal to justice
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Shutting down a crime lord's operation in your district
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Exposing corrupt officials*
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• <u>Power</u>: office space, got each other's back, blow off some steam
>  &nbsp;&nbsp;• <u>Weakness</u>: stepping on each other's toes

> ==BACKGROUND==
> A year ago, Enkidu was investigating a cry for help written on a mysterious note, which quickly lead to the discovery of a deep mafia influence backed by persons with supernatural powers. Attempts to investigate further were shut down by her superiors, who were obviously in the pocket of the mob, so she started her own unofficial investigation.
> 
> While following up on the rumor of a stylist dating one of the local mob bosses, Enkidu found a woman wearing a mystical bracelet standing outside of a hair salon. The woman was Excalibur and she had regularly patroned the establishment while in disguise, gathering local gossip to keep an eye on the district. The salon was not the only victim, and shops across the district had closed under the pressure of the mafia. Excalibur offered to lend her power and financial backing to remove the mafia influence from Miller's Square and Enkidu gratefully accepted.
> 
> During the course of their investigation, Enkidu and Excalibur came across Scarlet, a young girl who was out of her mind with worry over the abduction of her girlfriend Jill. It appeared that Jill had caught the eye of the mafia consigliere and he used his supernatural power of suggestion to enamor her, collecting her as a pet to keep in the backroom of his speakeasy.
> 
> The group freed Scarlet's girlfriend and discovered the source of the enforcers' supernatural abilities: a yearly feast of Ambrosia, a magical dish that grants godlike powers. They raided the feast and defeated the consigliere and a small army of mafia enforcers. Also present was a crazy shark lady enforcer and an ominous man controlling three dogs, but the pair escaped with a crate of Ambrosia.
> 
> Though the Ambrosia supply line had been cut, the shark lady later re-emerged to take the consigliere's place as the one controlling Miller's Square. Enkidu swore to continue her mission of freeing Miller's Square from the mafia influence and removing the corruption from her precinct. This aligned with Excalibur's goals and so she offered to lend her services when she could. Scarlet, grateful for the help in rescuing her girlfriend, also agreed to provide assistance, outside of school hours. The trio set up an informal base of operations in a closed-down office left behind by one of Enkidu's old colleagues. They tentatively named it "All-Seeing Eye Investigations."
