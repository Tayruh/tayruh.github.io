		  <p><strong>Telepathy:</strong> Telepathy can be used to read minds, transfer thoughts, alter memories or thoughts, or psionic attack. Telepathy can defend against only Telepathy. Telepathy can be defended against using Will or Telepathy.</p>
		  <p><strong>Telekinesis:</strong> Telekinesis is used to manipulate objects not held by the user or create defensive barriers. Telekinesis can defend against Fight, Shoot, Telekinesis, and Magic. Telekinesis attacking with objects can be defended against using Athletics, Telekinesis, or if you can plausibly attack the object, Shoot. Telekinesis moving or holding you directly can be defended against using Physique or Telekinesis.</p>
		  <p><strong>Magic:</strong> Magic is a catch-all skill for anything involving mystical energies. Most commonly it is used to create something out of nothing similar to Craft, but it may also be used to attack directly using energy similar to Shoot. Magic can defend against Shoot and Magic. Magic can be defended against using Athletics, Telekinesis, or Magic.</p>

Emma can make the change to diamond form so quickly that she may use it to react to gunshots at close range.</p>
		  <p><strong>Resources:</strong> Emma and her connections has been one of the best things to happen to the X-Men, especially with Xavier's wishy-washy standings with the government and society as of late. She basically finances the X-Men at this point.</p>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><mark>PERMISSIONS</mark><br>
		  <strong><a href="./images/magik/illyana%20(16).jpg">Stepping Disc</a>:</strong> Illyana's stepping disc portal can remain open as long as she wants and has been seen to grow large enough to swallow the X-Mansion. The portal opens quickly enough that she can use it as a means of dodging and countering in combat. While Illyana has been known to travel as far as the other side of the globe, traveling so far puts a strain on her ability and she runs the risk of arriving in the wrong place or even the wrong time. Illyana must always travel to Limbo as the final stop before her destination.</p>
		  <p><strong>Soulsword:</strong> Illyana's sword is formed from a piece of her soul and anyone in possession of the Soulsword is granted basic access to Illyana's abilities—namely magic and creating stepping discs. The Soulsword is not physically real, and therefore can only harm magical creatures.</p>
		  <p><strong>Eldritch Armor:</strong> Illyana can summon armor through magic, not unlike her brother Collosus's mutant ability. It also grants her increased strength.</p>
		  <p><strong>Demon Queen:</strong> Illyana is the ruler of Limbo and can summon demons via her stepping disc to fight by her side.</p>
		  <p><strong><a href="./images/magik/illyana%20(15).jpg">Darkchylde</a>:</strong> When Illyana is overcome with emotions such as anger, she "hulks out" and becomes Darkchylde, which is the form of the demon queen of Limbo. She has difficulty maintaining control over her mind and emotions in this form and basically becomes another personality, usually attacking her allies. While in this form, she denies any attempts of telepathic probing used against her. Illyana will revert to normal when rendered unconscious.</p>
