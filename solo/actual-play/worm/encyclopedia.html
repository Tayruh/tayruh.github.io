		<p>This story is set in the world of the web novel series <em>Worm</em> by Wildbow: <a target="_blank" href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com">https://parahumans.wordpress.com</a></p>
		<p>The following is a summary of characters and concepts found in this actual play that may be confusing to those have not read the series. I will try to avoid big spoilers. I also highly recommend reading the Worm series as it is one of my favorite works of fiction.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• For those that have read the story, this actual play begins at around chapter 12.1 of Worm, which is about 25% into the series, right after rescuing Charlotte from the Merchants.</p>
		<h5 id="brockton%20bay">Brockton Bay</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Worm takes place in Brockton Bay, a fictional city located somewhere in New England of the United States, Earth Bet. This alternate world has superpowered beings (called parahumans, or the slang term "capes") like those in Marvel or DC comics, and like those comics, the parahumans tend to fall decisively on either the hero or villain side of the spectrum. The heroes have a team of defenders (like DC's Justice League) called the Protectorate, with a junior set (like DC's Teen Titans) called the Wards.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The city of Brockton Bay is currently recovering from the fallout of a large event; the aftermath of which allowed the Undersiders to divide and conquer the city. The city is now fully under the control of the villains and the heroes have been unable to interfere. It is at this point that the Slaughterhouse Nine has appeared in Brockton Bay, to add even more chaos to the disaster left behind by the event.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Brockton_Bay">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="charlotte">Charlotte</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter's employee (she refuses to call them henchmen or minions) that helps manage her territory. She's a non-powered human that primarily liasons between Skitter and the civilians, as well as orders supplies for the territory. Charlotte used to attend high school with Taylor.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="coil">Coil</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Coil is the backer behind the Undersiders. He funds their projects, including their providing them with bases in their territories and all of their supplies, as well as any mercenaries that they may need. All he requires is that they complete jobs for him when asked.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Coil is very enigmatic: no one knows his true name or intentions, though it's clear that he's working toward something. Only Tattletale knows his powers and she's under orders to never reveal them. He is also morally questionable, not even ashamed of having kidnapped and forced a drug addiction on a twelve year old so that he can keep her as a pet.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Coil">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="dinah">Dinah</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• She is a young girl with the power to see multiple futures. Her power works best when someone asks a question, to which she can answer the probability of it happening within multiple decimal places. Using her power too much causes crippling migraines. Coil keeps her drugged with what she refers to as "candy" to keep her complacent and relieve the side-effects of her power.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Dinah_Alcott">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="emma">Emma</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Emma was Taylor's best friend through childhood until she met Sophia. For whatever reason, the two of them began a two year bullying campaign against Taylor at school. The bullying escalated to the degree that Taylor had a breakdown and a short stint in a mental hospital. The bullying continued upon returning and Taylor eventually dropped out when the faculty wouldn't do anything about it.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Emma_Barnes">[wiki]</a> </p>
		<h5 id="mannequin">Mannequin</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A member of the Slaughterhouse Nine. His power revolves around developing technology for sealed systems that exists far beyond the current level of modern day technology. He has used this ability to replace all of his own body parts with that technology, sealing his organs inside metal vacuum sealed units. This somehow allows his body to be modular, with the ability to disconnect and reconnect his arms or even his head at will. His forearms are attached by cables, and he can fiire them like a cannon and then reel back in. A telescoping blade can extend from the center of his palms. He can also release a flammable poisonous gas from his mouth.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Mannequin never speaks and instead communicates through body language and other means.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Mannequin">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20merchants">The Merchants</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Merchants were a gang racists, thugs, rednecks, and generally nasty and disgusting people that were all about drugs, guns, raping, fighting, and basically being horrible human beings. The Merchant gang members were not parahumans but the gang leaders were.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter found a classmate of hers, Charlotte, being forced to dance during a Merchant rally and rescued her. The following day, the Slaughterhouse Nine wiped the Merchants off the face of the planet. Nothing of value was lost.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Archer's_Bridge_Merchants">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20pure">The Pure</h5>
		<p>When the superpowered hate group Empire Eighty-Eight dissolved after the death of its leader, Kaiser, it reformed into two groups: The Pure and The Chosen. Of the two, The Pure is not quite as racist and packs a lot more power. It is lead by Purity, the ex-wife of Kaiser.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pure">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="regent%20(alec)">Regent (Alec)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent is a young member of the Undersiders who also happens to be a sociopath. He acts like he cares, because it's what he's supposed to do, but he probably wouldn't actually care if all of his teammates died, with the possible exception of Imp.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent's power is that he can control nervous system impulses of his target. This manifests in two ways: the quickest and minimal use causes his target to misfire (stumbling, dropping something, pulling a trigger, etc), and the long term use allows him to completely take over the target's nervous system and control them like a puppet. When controlling a puppet he has access to their senses, speech, and muscle memory.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent also likes to carry around a scepter to match his regal costume. The scepter has a stun taser hidden in its crown.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Jean-Paul_%22Alec%22_Vasil">[wiki]</a> </p>
		<h5 id="shadow%20stalker%20(sophia)">Shadow Stalker (Sophia)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Shadow Stalker's power is that she can turn into mist that is as light as air and can travel through solid objects. Electricity appears to be deadly to her when in this state though. Her favored weapon is a crossbow. When she joined the Wards they made her use tranquilizer darts, but she'd switch to steel stipped arrows whenever they weren't looking.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• At her core, Shadow Stalker is not a very good person. She is a vigilante that was forced to be on a hero team due to a court order because the alternative was jail. When out of costume, Sophia went to the same school as Taylor and, with the help of Taylor's ex-bestfriend Emma, has bullied Taylor for years and made her life absolute hell.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Through an unexpected event, Taylor discovered that Shadow Stalker was Sophia, and wasn't all that heartbroken to have her teammate Regent possess Shadow Stalker's body in the attempt to infiltrate the Ward HQ. At the end of this, Regent took things a bit further by ruining Sophia's home life and then revealing her illegal use of arrows, which violated her parole.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Stalker">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="skitter%20(taylor)">Skitter (Taylor)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter/Taylor is the main character of the story. She is a high school girl with the ability to control bugs with her mind. While seemingly an ineffective power, it becomes devastating when used on the scale at which she can operate.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter can control all bugs within a 5 block radius with no upper limit to the amount that she can control, easily able to control millions with no effort. She has an unparalleled multitasking ability that allows her to send unique commands to each individual bug, as well as receive sensory input and the exact location of every bug in relation to herself. The latter allows her relative omniscience within the radius of her power.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Favored tricks of hers are to form swarms of her bugs into decoys that look exactly like her (covering herself in bugs to look like them as well), modulate the pitch of the swarm's buzzing to form spoken words, position her bugs to form words in the sky, form large nets spun by thousands of spiders, and lace the stingers of her insects with capsaicin to greatly increase their effectiveness.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter's outfit is made from spider-silk and insect carapaces, making it highly resistance to piercing attacks. Taylor believes in always being prepared, and so she carries a telescoping police baton, a military-grade combat knife, a can of pepper spray, a hand gun, and various other useful items tucked in pockets of her outfit.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Taylor originally wanted to be a hero, and in fact joined the Undersiders with the intent to gather intel on them and then sell them out to the Protectorate, in the hopes that it would gain her cred so that they'd put her on a team. But then she learned that heroes can be every bit as bad as villains, and so she decided to stay with the Undersiders. This idea was reinforced when she learned that the only way to free Dinah from Coil was to bargain her away from him by making herself a valuable tool.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Taylor_Hebert">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="slaughterhouse%20nine">Slaughterhouse Nine</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Slaughterhouse Nine is a ragtag collection of nightmare fuel villains that heroes and villains alike fear like boogeymen. The Nine travels the country with the sole purpose of creating chaos and fear wherever they go. The team is normally composed of nine members, but when their membership drops due to death, they go recruiting. The Nine is currently down a member and is recruiting.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Slaughterhouse Nine are Jack Slash, Mannequin, Bonesaw, Shatterbird, Burnscar, The Siberian, Crawler, and Cherish.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterhouse_Nine">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="tattletale%20(lisa)">Tattletale (Lisa)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Tattletale invited Skitter to join the Undersiders and they quickly became best friends. No one has been as unwaveringly supportive of Taylor as Lisa, even in the light of her attempt to sell out the group to the heroes. Lisa is very snarky and her mouth frequently gets her in trouble.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Tattletale's power is that she has a voice in her head that constantly analyzes everything she sees and hears, extrapolates ridiculous levels of information from the details, and draws connections to form unbelievable and accurate conclusions–such as being able to determine someone's numeric pin based on their casual clothes or know the layout of an entire office building from a photo of the lobby. Information is power though, so she keeps the nature of her power a secret by spreading the rumor that she is a telepath.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Since Lisa's power is not combat centric, she carries a gun with her whenever she goes out.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Wilbourn">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20undersiders">The Undersiders</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Undersiders started as a relatively harmless group of villains that only did small jobs and whose only claim to fame was that they could never be caught. Once Skitter joined, her high degree of tactical ability allowed them to execute higher profile jobs, making complete fools out of both the Wards and even the Protectorate. And then taking advantage of a horrible situation with the assistance of their backer, Coil, they took out their competition and claimed the entire city. While the Undersiders may be lawbreaking, they are not very villainous as far as villains go, and in fact risk their lives to protect civilians in the territories that they have claimed.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Undersiders are Skitter, Tattletale, Grue, Regent, Bitch, and Imp.<br>
