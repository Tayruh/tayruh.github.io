<blockquote>
<p><strong>Framing:</strong> flashback, preparation, negotiation<br />
<strong>Elemental Motif:</strong> [The Dweller in the Waters. A
woman-octopus, singing idly as she waits.] A woman with a lot of secrets
and a mysterious purpose. Perhaps the witch mentioned in the initial
motif?</p>
<p>Show a flashback of you interrogating the town witch even though you
don't believe in magic.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the witch young?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [2, 5] Yes, but she says it's only because of a
spell.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is she attracted to me?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [6, 6] (ignore flaw) Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few months ago I found myself in the cabin of a young woman names
Seraphine. She was an attractive red-head with a fair complexion. I had
come to her residence to ask her a few questions and she graciously let
me in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What am I asking about?<br />
<strong>Elemental Motif:</strong> [Fertility. Purposeful Growth
(Wantonness). A casual proposition hides a dark motive.] She had some
sort of connection with the daughter. Relationship?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked her about her relation to the young woman in question,
Abigail, as there had been rumors around town about the two being
close.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does she confirm?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [2, 5] Yes, but..<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> (Act 1) someone feels something<br />
<strong>Elemental Motif:</strong> [Satyr. Tolerance (Enthusiasm). People
don't always know when they are happy.] They cut their fling short
because one of them took the situation for granted.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was the witch the one to cut it off?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [6, 6] (flawed) She did, but she's been trying
to get back together but the girl refuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She explained--in perhaps unnecessary detail--the couple's
relationship. It was mostly a fling; social gatherings and booty calls.
Seraphine had grown tired of the arrangement and cut it off, but then
had second thoughts weeks later. She explained that Abigail had grown
distant, however. She was preoccupied with something and refused to take
visitors--not even her ex-lover.</p>
<p>I asked if she had any idea what could be bothering Abigail. She was
quick to deny it, but it felt like she knew more and so I pushed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Convince her to tell me what she knows.<br />
<strong>Danger:</strong> Seraphine will get angry for not believing
her.<br />
<strong>Strive:</strong> (charm, persuade) [6, 4 + 2] (clock) Strong
Hit: Gain the light die <em>Seraphine is willing to help</em><br />
<strong>Story Motif:</strong> [An unwelcome inheritance, dreams of a
stranger, a clue in the earth.] My family has a history with
demons?<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> Turn someoneâ€™s action back on
them.<br />
<strong>Clock:</strong> 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"She was scared. It looked like she hadn't slept in days. She kept
whispering to herself about demons," Seraphine said. She studied my face
and then she smirked as she asked, "What do you know of demons? I've
heard tales of your family."</p>
<p>"More than I'd like, but nothing that I believe," I said. I returned
to the line of questioning, "Do you know where Abigail may have
gone?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does she have any idea?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [5, 5] (flawed) She may not have left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Are you sure she's actually gone?" she asked in return.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"There are different planes of reality layered upon one another. They
exist in the same physical space, but shifted. Demons are said to exist
on planes like these. Since she was raving about demons, perhaps she is
still at home but on another plane." Seraphine said this ridiculous
statement without a hint of amusement.</p>
<p>I was at a loss on how to respond. When I did not, she continued, "I
have some free time if you would like me to accompany you."</p>
<p>After a moment of consideration, I agreed. Even if she was off her
rocker, she may still bring extra insight into the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add the story motif <em>A promiscuous witch, a little too happy to
help, but full of secrets.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Framing:</strong> aftermath, investigation, interrupt<br />
<strong>Story Motif:</strong> [A small-time psychic, offering details of
a crime only the killer could know.] Does Seraphine know more than she
is letting on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We arrived at Abigail's house together. I knocked, but of course
there was no answer. Abigail lived alone now that her father had
passed.</p>
<p>Her father's death was a burden on me. A case that I failed to solve
in time that resulted in the young girl losing her only parental figure.
A feeling of obligation lead to me checking in with her occasionally. It
was this last visit in which I had learned that she hadn't been seen for
days.</p>
<p>After confirming that the street was empty, I pulled out my lockpick.
It took only a few moments and then the door was unlocked and we were
safely inside.</p>
<p>Seraphine mentioned that I seemed to be quite familiar with the
door's lock, and I explained how I had let myself in yesterday when she
didn't answer the door.</p>
<p>"Don't you think that's overly intrusive?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I worry about her. I wanted to make sure she wasn't hurt or
dead."</p>
<p>"That's sweet. For the most part," Seraphine said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've decided to give myself the rank-2 trauma <em>Overprotective</em>
as it fits my view of the character.</p>
<p><strong>Catalyst:</strong> something vital is missing<br />
<strong>Dark Motif:</strong> [what dreams may come] Something related to
Abigail's future plans is missing?<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> What is missing?<br />
<strong>Minor Motif:</strong> [harmony and satisfaction] Perhaps she
wanted to be a musician. Maybe her violin is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the house look?<br />
<strong>Minor Motif:</strong> [small attachment; minor bond] She kept it
the same as when her father lived there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two of us searched the small house for any signs of a struggle,
or a note, or--god help me--a portal into another dimension. We came up
empty.</p>
<p>The house seemed unchanged since I last saw it, which in turn was
unchanged since the last time I saw her father. The poor girl refused to
put away any items of his and still kept his jacket by the door and his
coffee mug on the counter.</p>
<p>"That is strange," Seraphine said, breaking the silence of the
search. "Where is her violin?"</p>
<p>"Violin?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You weren't aware? Abigail was a proficient violinist. Her
dream was to leave this small town and join an orchestra. Sadly, no one
ever leaves this town."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she did. We should check the train station to see if she
purchased a ticket."</p>
<br>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Framing:</strong> transition, negotiation, flashback<br />
<strong>General Motif:</strong> [ROSE: A cruel enchantment, robbing a
warrior of her skills, forcing adaptation.] I'm failing at my detective
work, so I need to change my approach.<br />
<strong>Catalyst:</strong> someone gets into a fight<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> Who gets into a fight?<br />
<strong>People Motif:</strong> [Those Who Are: The Life-Tree. Adorned
with eyes; the bitterest wisdom imparted is that some prices are too
high to pay.] Someone wants me to stop looking for Abigail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We arrived at the train station around noon. It was vacant, as it
always was every time I came to this town. There was only one person in
the entire place and that was the ticket holder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the ticket holder like?<br />
<strong>People Motif:</strong> [Those Who Guide: The Twin Ravens. Memory
and Thought, inextricably linked, shaping reality around them.] An
older, intelligent man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I approached the man in the booth. "Excuse me, but I'm looking for a
young girl. I was hoping you could tell me whether you've seen her."</p>
<p>The man looked up from the newspaper that he was reading. "A lot of
young women come through here. I'm afraid you'll have to be more
specific."</p>
<p>"Well, we both know that's not true. No one comes through here. If
you saw her, you'd remember."</p>
<p>The man eyed me from behind the glass. "Then I didn't see
anyone."</p>
<p>"He's being awfully cagey," Seraphine said.</p>
<p>"I agree." I edged up closer to the glass. "What aren't you telling
me?"</p>
<p>He raised his newspaper and pretended to read. "I'm afraid I don't
know anything. But perhaps Samuel has seen your missing girl."</p>
<p>From around the booth came a large man. He looked not unlike a mafia
strongman, and appeared to share a similar purpose. The man stalked
towards me and reached out for my collar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I attempt to dodge.<br />
<strong>Danger:</strong> He grapples me.<br />
<strong>Strive:</strong> (light die: Seraphine's help) [6,5] (clock)
Strong Hit: Gain the light die <em>Seraphine has my back</em><br />
<strong>Story Motif:</strong> [a promiscuous witch, a little too happy
to help, but full of secrets; what does she really want from me?]
Seraphine, obviously.<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> [Use someoneâ€™s character aspects against
them.] Rumors about her being a witch.<br />
<strong>Clock:</strong> 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strong man grabbed me by the collar and lifted me from the
ground. I was at a severe disadvantage with my feet dangling inches
above solid footing. Just then the man let out a yelp and crumpled to
the ground, releasing me in the process. Seraphine stood above us and
looked angrily down at the man.</p>
<p>The man held his nether regions and groaned in pain. When he finally
looked up to see his assailant, he looked shocked. "Wait. I know you.
You're that witch."</p>
<p>"What do you know about me?" Seraphine peered down at him with her
hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"The whole town knows about you. You're the witch that lives in the
woods. They say you lead children to your cottage and eat them like in
that fairytale... Hans and Greta."</p>
<p>"Hansel and Gretel. Simpleton," she says. "And no, I do not."</p>
<p>The man scuttled away from her. "Whatever you say. Just don't kill
me, alright?"</p>
<p>She stalked towards him. "Okay, then. Where is Abigail?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does he tell her anything?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [5,2+1] Yes, but..<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> Reveal an unwelcome truth.<br />
<strong>Elemental Motif:</strong> [AIR: skill, strategy, society â€¢
intellect; Spring. Newness (Decay). Rejoice in the ephemeral, before it
is gone.] He doesn't know the current whereabouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He held up his hands. "I don't know. I delivered her to the boss and
that's the last I saw of her. I have no idea where she is now."</p>
<p>"And where can we find this boss of yours?" I asked him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where would they be?<br />
<strong>Minor Motif:</strong> [hard work, arrest of decay] A funeral
home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He looked up at me like he only just remembered that I was there.
"She owns the funeral home in town. Alice."</p>
<p>Seraphine gave me a quizzical look but I was just as surprised. What
was going on?</p>
<br>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Framing:</strong> pay-off or choice, introduction,
escape/pursuit<br />
<strong>Lock-in Goal:</strong> save themselves from a threat<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> Reveal an unwelcome truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a small town; the funeral home was easy to find, even without
Seraphine guiding the way. We entered the front door and found ourselves
in a spacious yet cozy parlor. An elegant woman in a blue dress stood in
the center of the room. She turned towards us at the sound of the door
chime.</p>
<p>"Welcome," she said. "How may I help you?"</p>
<p>I removed my hat and gave a light bow. "Good morning, ma'am. Would
you be Alice?"</p>
<p>She blinked. "Yes? May I know who is asking?"</p>
<p>"My name is Jack. I am a detective. This is my companion, Seraphine.
We are looking into the disappearance of a young woman named Abigail.
Have you seen her?"</p>
<p>Alice smiled politely. It was a fake smile. "Unless she is dead, I
haven't seen her. Why would you inquire here, of all places?"</p>
<p>"I have reason to believe that you've been in contact with her," I
said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does she answer me?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [4,5] (clock) Yes, but..<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> (oracle) [Reveal an unwelcome truth.]
Abigail is dead.<br />
<strong>Dramatic Move:</strong> (clock) Offer a hard bargain or an ugly
choice.<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> What are the choices?<br />
<strong>Minor Motif:</strong> [distressed; in need of assistance]
Seraphine is in danger.<br />
<strong>Minor Motif:</strong> [strength through what is seized] Lose
Abigail.<br />
<strong>Clock:</strong> 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She continued to smile. "Like I said, unless she is dead, I haven't
seen her. You are in luck, however, as she is indeed dead." She turned
to her side and looked toward the room connecting to the parlor. "Isn't
that right, Abigail?"</p>
<p>A scuffing sound came from the side; the sound of a foot being
dragged as they walked. Neither Seraphine nor I wanted to look. We did
not want to believe that Abigail was dead. Further more, we did not want
to believe that she became a monstrosity. However, we did not have to
turn, because soon Abigail stood before us.</p>
<p>Our friend looked like death. Her hair was ragged and hung in front
of her face. Her clothes were disheveled. Her fingernails were chipped
and torn and bloody, like she had been digging at the walls. Her head
hung low, as though it were too heavy to been supported by her neck. She
let out raspy breathes that fell somewhere between wheezing and
panting.</p>
<p>"Abigail...?" Seraphine asked tentatively.</p>
<p>The ragged girl peered at Seraphine through gap in her dirty locks of
hair. She just wheezed and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Seraphine, stay back. I don't trust her," I said.</p>
<p>"But... it's my Abigail."</p>
<p>Seraphine took a step toward her friend. Alice crossed her arms and
rested her chin in the palm of her hand as she observed. Her face lit up
with amusement at the events unfolding before her.</p>
<p>Abigail immediately lunged at Seraphine. The woman barely had time to
react and managed to hold her friend at arms length. Abigail snapped her
jaws at Seraphine. I raised my gun at Abigail and shouted for her to
step away but my demands fell on deaf ears. Alice laughed
hysterically.</p>
<p>I swore and pulled the trigger. Abigail stumbled back just long
enough for Seraphine to break free. She ran to me and practically hid
behind my back. I kept my gun trained on Abigail and Alice. Alice
continued to laugh.</p>
<p>Abigail regained her composure and started after us. I was somehow
relieved that she appeared to be okay, despite the fact that I had given
her a gut wound. However, she was clearly still a threat that we
couldn't handle at the moment, and so I made a strategic retreat with
Seraphine. Abigail gave chase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Outrun Abigail.<br />
<strong>Danger:</strong> Abigail catches them.<br />
<strong>Strive:</strong> (clever, distract, light die: Seraphine has my
back) [6,2+2] Strong Hit: Gain the light die <em>distraction</em><br />
<strong>Q:</strong> How should I distract her?<br />
<strong>Elemental Motif:</strong> [FIRE: body, action, transform â€¢
vigor; Sword. Strike (Parry). A double-edged sword, not yet bloody.]
Scare her with fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seraphine and I bolted for the exit but Abigail was hot on our heels.
For a zombie, she was incredibly quick. We made it to the door, but
before we could open it, Abigail was upon us.</p>
<p>The girl once again attacked Seraphine. It was all she could do to
fight off. I tried pulling Abigail off of her but she was incredibly
strong and resisted. Not sure what else to do, I lit my lighter and
waved it in her face. Abigail reared back and batted at the flame, but
it gave Seraphine enough time to escape out the door.</p>
<p>Unlucky for me, however, Abigail was positioned between me and the
door. Having lost her prey, she gave me her undivided attention. I waved
the flame back and forth in front of her face, attempting to stave her
off. She growled and swatted at it like a kitten. I was unsure whether
she was scared of the flame or wanted to play with it.</p>
<p>Not seeing a better option, I tossed the lighter to the side in the
hopes that she was in fact enamored by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Abigail go for the flame?<br />
<strong>Oracle:</strong> [4, 5] Yes, but... it's super effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the lighter landed wasn't at the forefront of my mind at the
time, but in hindsight I should have perhaps taken care with my aim. The
lighter landed directly at the foot of the window drapes and they
immediately went up in flames. I could hear Alice yell in anger behind
me, but I couldn't care less. All that mattered in the moment was that I
was right--Abigail was enthralled by the flames. She watched with
dazzled eyes as the flames traveled up the drapes and along the
ceiling.</p>
<p>With her distracted, I escaped the building. Seraphine there was
waiting nervously for me outside. I grabbed her hand and we ran.</p>
