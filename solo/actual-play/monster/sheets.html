		  <p><strong>Spunky</strong> d8<br>
		  Erin is always cheerful and energetic, easily making new friends. While her attitude is endearing to most, she often finds that people won't take her seriously.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Friendly Face:</em> When you first meet a human who is not hostile towards you, you may gain them as a friendly asset for free; if you spend a PP, you may step up the die rating. You may spend this asset to recover your Afraid, Angry, or Insecure stress.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>You Don’t Scare Me:</em> When you would take or step up Afraid stress, spend a PP to step that stress down once.</p>
		  <p><strong>Mama's Girl</strong> d8<br>

		  <p>Gray. Last name unknown.</p>
		  <p><mark>DISTINCTIONS</mark><br>
		  <strong>Bogeyman</strong> d8<br>
		  Gray is the thing of children's nightmares. He uses his fearmongering abilities to scare children, feeding off their fear—and occasionally feeding on the children themselves.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Crack in the Armor:</em> When you include an opponent’s Afraid or Insecure stress in your dice pool, you can spend a PP to step that stress up.</p>
		  <p><strong>Frightening</strong> d8<br>
		  Even when not intentionally scaring children, Gray has an overwhelming presence. Whether it's due to his fear aura or just his body language, one look at Gray promises a bad time if he can get you alone.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Did You Know… :</em> Gain a PP after you reveal a dramatic secret.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Self-Sufficient:</em> When you are in a test, contest, or challenge against an opponent alone, spend a PP to double your kindred distinction die and keep an extra die in your total.</p>
		  <p><strong>Mysterious</strong> d8<br>
		  No one is sure what brought Gray to the mansion or why he continues to reside there. For now at least, the boarding house appears to suit his purpose.</p>

		  <p><strong>Yandere</strong> d8<br>
		  What started as a crush has bloomed into full blown obsession thanks her enthrallment. Jess's devotion to Cami has become murderously overprotective and possessive.<br>

		  <p><strong>Distinctions:</strong> The three distinctions are the character's role, personality, and background. Each are d8 and come with the standard SFX of "Hinder: Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction's die for a d4." Assign three more SFX across the three distinctions—ideally one to earn a PP and two that cost a PP. Premade SFX taken from Tales of Xadia.</p>
		  <p><strong>Relationships:</strong> You are given one d10, two d8s, and two d6s to assigned to relationships. Each has a trait statement. All relationships not assigned a die are assumed to be d4.</p>
		  <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> You are given three d8s and three d6s to be assigned to the attributes <em>Agility, Awareness, Intellect, Presence, Spirit, and Strength</em>. You may step down an attribute to step up another, but not below d4 or above d10.</p>
		  <p><strong>Power Sets:</strong> The number of power sets are not fixed—humans usually have none, myths usually have only one, and more powerful myths have two or three. For each set you're given two d10s to be assigned to powers in that set. You may step down a power to add another power to that set at the same size. All power sets come with "Limit: Shut down a power in this set to gain a PP. Restore with an opportunity or in the next scene." If it doesn't make narrative sense to single out a power to be shut down, the entire set is shut down for only 1 PP. Power sets do not have SFX as they will be handled through distinction SFX.</p>
		  <p><strong>Specialties:</strong> You're given two d10s to be assigned to the specialties <em>Craft, Drive, Fight, Fix, Fly, Focus, Influence, Know, Labor, Move, Notice, Operate, Perform, Shoot, Sneak, Survive, Throw, Treat, and Trick</em>. You may step down a specialty to add another specialty at the same size. Know must have an area of expertise, and requires an additional Know specialty for each additional area. </p>
		  <p><strong>Stress:</strong> The stress types are <em>Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, Injured, and Insecure</em>. Myths also have <em>Monstrous</em>.</p>
		  <p><strong>Goals:</strong> You may have up to three goals active at once. Assign a goal by describing what you want to accomplish in connection with a relationship, then give it a die rating between d6 and d12 to represent its difficulty. Its rating cannot be higher than the connected relationship rating.</p>
		  <p><strong>Earning Plot Points:</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Roll a hitch that the GM activates<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Give in during a contest <br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate an SFX like Hinder<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Engage in remarkable moments of roleplaying </p>
		  <p><strong>Spending Plot Points:</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate SFX <br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <del>Add two dice from a trait set instead of one</del><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate an opportunity that the GM rolls<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <del>Avoid being taken out</del><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Create a d6 asset for a single test, contest, or challenge<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Keep an asset for the rest of the session<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Include an additional result in your total<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Interfere in a contest<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Keep an extra effect die<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Share an asset with everyone in a scene</p>
