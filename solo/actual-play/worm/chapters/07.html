		  <p><strong>Campaign Elements:</strong> Swap out <em>The Pure</em> faction for <em>The Undersiders</em>, and <em>The Chosen</em> trouble for <em>Shadow Stalker</em> to better support the current narrative.</p>
		  <p><strong>Begin a Scene:</strong> [Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place, or faction] Sure. But who?<br>
		  <strong>Campaign Elements:</strong> [Save Dinah] This probably has to do with Coil's response to us joining forces with the heroes.<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Reveal Love] Actually, I think this more about Skitter and Dinah.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Our successful recruitment of the heroes had earned me a bit of good will with Coil. I chose to spend it by requesting time with Dinah. I needed to be sure she was okay.</p>
		<p>I stood before the room assigned to Dinah as her bedroom. A pair of armed guards were positioned on either side of the door. I would have loved to believe that they were there to protect Dinah, but I knew that they were in fact there to prevent the emaciated child from escaping. The guards opened the door for me and I stepped inside. </p>
		<p>The room wasn't a cell, but it may as well have been. It was a drab gray without decoration or furnishings of any kind beyond the cot that was her bed. </p>
		<p>Dinah lay on the bed, dead to the world. If it weren't for the slight movement of her tiny chest as she breathed, I would have thought she were an actual corpse. Her hair was dirty and fragile looking. Her skin was ashen and her eyes were sunken. She looked like a homeless drug addict, not a twelve-year-old from a wealthy family.</p>
		<p>I took a seat on the stool beside her cot. "Dinah?" I called to her softly.</p>
		<p>Her eyes remained closed but she moaned in acknowledgement.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Dinah. It's me, Skitter." I reached out and placed my hand atop hers. She flinched but didn't reject me. "I just wanted to make sure you're okay."</p>
		<p>"My head hurts," she mumbled.</p>
		<p>I nodded, then realized that she couldn't see me. "I know. Coil has been working you too hard." The words came out harsh and bitter. I closed my eyes and took in a breath, trying to calm myself for the child. "I'm going to get you out of here, okay? I have an agreement with Coil. He promised to let you go if I can make myself as useful to him as you are."</p>
		<p>Dinah turned her head toward me and opened her eyes. She looked like she immediately regretted it as she squinted to shield herself the overhead light.</p>
		<p>"He won't let me go," she said with conviction.</p>
		<p>I shook my head. "No. I'll make sure that he does."</p>
		<p>"Skitter," Dinah said, looking upon me with pity. "There is a five point nine three percent chance that Coil does as he's told you. He won't let me go."</p>
		<p>I was silent while I considered the implications. Dinah's predictions were never wrong. She couldn't see the future, exactly, just the probability of a certain result based on factored conditions across all potential futures. A 5.93% chance was not very promising. I never actually trusted Coil to uphold his end of the deal, but to have it spelled out in black and white like that was disheartening.</p>
		<p>I gripped her hand in mine. "I'll find another way, then. We have the heroes on our side for the moment. I'll find another way."</p>
		<p>Dinah looked at me again and winced, the same pained expression she always had when she ran the numbers.</p>
		<p>"I believe you," she said, merely a whisper.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Develop Your Relationship:</strong> Mark 1 progress on <em>Coil</em> connection (0&nbsp;<sup>2/4</sup>).</p>
		  <p><strong>Reach a Milestone:</strong> Mark 1 progress on <em>Save Dinah</em> vow (0&nbsp;<sup>1/4</sup>).</p>
		  <p><strong>Begin a Scene:</strong> Take +1 momentum (3).</p>
