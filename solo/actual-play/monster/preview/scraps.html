		<p><mark>Seoyun took a step in front of me, blocking most of Cami from my view. "What happened to you two?" Her voice held a trace of mocking laughter.</mark></p>
		<p>Cami casually flipped her dripping hair, flinging water droplets at Seoyun. "Quiet, dog."</p>
		<p>From the way Seoyun had turned her head and staggered, the water appeared to have hit its mark. Seoyun snapped her head back toward the vampire princess and snarled, the muscles along her body visibly tightened at the ready. </p>
		<p>The air was tense as the two women stared each other down, and I braced myself to intervene, but then Finola began bouncing on my head with a happy chant of "Fight! Fight! Fight!"</p>
		<p>Cami turned cool eyes on the faerie, but a ghost of a smile appeared on her lips before it vanished beneath her royal facade, and I knew the fight was over. She straightened her posture, and set about combing out the length of her damp hair with delicate fingers.</p>
		<p><mark>"If you must know, Jessamine and I went for a delightful stroll in rain."</mark></p>
		<p><mark>A while back, when discussing amenities, I had asked Cami whether it was true that vampires couldn't cross running water. She had laughed, then asked me in return, What constitutes running water? A river, a faucet, a rain drop? It was nearly impossible to take a step on land without crossing groundwater buried somewhere beneath its surface, she had informed me. No, the inability to cross running water was an old wives tale, or going with the theory that myths are borne of belief, not enough people believed in that particular weakness to make it a reality. Whichever the case, Cami was grateful, since she was fond of her showers and baths. And walking in the rain, apparently.</mark></p>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="scrap%202">Scrap 2</h2>
		<p><mark>"You two should go get out of those wet clothes," I suggested, hoping to win a bit of favor with Jess. "Besides, you don't want to be around when Vanessa discovers the giant puddle that you've made."</mark></p>
		<p><mark>I meant it as a joke, but the two of them stilled at my words. Cami gave me a look, and in her eyes I could see that even our master vampire was afraid of our housemaid. Then, Cami put her mask back in place and the look disappeared behind her patented elegant smile.</mark></p>
		<p><mark>"As you wish, housemaster. We shall make ourselves more presentable." She curtsied in her black gown that tried its best to cling to her. "Come, Jessamine."</mark></p>
		<p>As the two of them made their exit, Seoyun stood next to me, so close that her shoulder touched mine. "That's right. Run along like good little girls."</p>
		<p>Ascending the stairs toward their room on the second floor, Cami shot back, "Hold your tongue, dog."</p>
		<p>The kumiho bristled beside me and growled, playing right into Cami's hands. The princess laughed, a cheerful, beautiful laugh that oozed with arrogance, like that of a fallen angel. It made me wonder whether the laugh was yet another part of her facade. If so, I wasn't sure that I had ever heard her real laugh, which made me a bit sad to consider.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="scrap%203">Scrap 3</h2>
		<p>"Ya know," Seoyun began with a smirk, looking straight at Jess, "The bug was suggesting that we invite Melody here. What do you say to that?"</p>
		<p>Jess narrowed her eyes, looking between Seoyun and me, like she had sensed a trap. But if she was expecting to read me, she was out of luck. I was just as clueless as her.</p>
		<p>Cami straightened her spine. "I do not know this Melody. Who is she?"</p>
		<p>Jess attempted to answer but Seoyun spoke over her. "She's a girl from town. A friend of Erin's."</p>
		<p>"I am Erin's friend."</p>
		<p>The iris of Jess's eyes burned bright blue, like a sapphire flame had flared to life behind them.</p>
		<p>The kumiho laughed at her. "A real friend."</p>
		<p>"Seoyun," I said in exasperation, and she grinned at me.</p>
		<p>I didn't need Seoyun picking a fight with Jess, and honestly, I don't even know why she was trying to. If Seoyun's goal was to keep Cami away from me, shouldn't she be playing cupid between the two of them, not antagonizing the one that wasn't a threat to her? I'm not sure that I'll ever understand her mind games.</p>
		<p>"Seoyun is right, though," Finola said from atop my head. I actually forgot she was even there, she'd been so quiet. "Erin needs a real human friend."</p>
		<p>Jess scowled. "I'm human."</p>
		<p><mark>We all just looked at her. If the two-hundred-or-whatever-year-old wall-crawling woman with the glowing eyes and car-lifting strength wanted to claim that she was still human, that was a level of denial that none of us wanted to touch.</mark></p>
		<p>Cami politely cleared her throat before speaking. "Erin does appear lonely at times. Perhaps engaging with one who is more akin to her would be beneficial."</p>
		<p>"Really, Cami?" I asked in disbelief. "I thought that you of all people would understand how dangerous inviting a human here would be." I caught a glare from Jess. "A real, er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A human not already knowledgeable of myths."</p>
		<p>Jess continued to narrow her eyes at me, but she seemed mollified by my clarification.</p>
		<p>Cami lifted her shoulders in a graceful shrug. "Were it to become a problem, it would cost me no effort to make her forget that this place and its residents had ever existed."</p>
		<p><mark>I frowned at that. I hated that she could do that to people. How did I get so lucky as to be courted by two women with mind wipe abilities?</mark></p>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="final">Final</h2>
		<p>Seoyun didn't seem to appreciate the effect that Cami was having on me, because the kumiho took a step toward the vampire princess, placing herself between two of us, with her back to me. My vision became obscured entirely by two fluffy tails which caressed the sides of my face.</p>
		<p><mark>"What happened to you two?" Seoyun asked the pair as she teased me. I could hear the smile in her voice.</mark></p>
		<p>Honestly, her tails felt pretty nice against my skin, like giant feather dusters, but it was a bit like breathing into a fuzzy blanket. It was also incredibly embarrassing and I valued being able to see, so I took a step back.</p>
		<p>Her tails followed me. I dodged to the right, and they tracked my movement, smothering my face again. What started as a possessive act became a game for her, and after multiple failed attempts at dodging her, I gave up on being polite, and moved as far away her as I could. I scowled at her, and she just smiled at me like the cat that got the cream.</p>
		<p><mark>Cami's mask was cracking, and she puffed her cheeks in frustration. "If you must know, Jessamine and I went for a delightful stroll in rain."</mark></p>
		<p>Jess huffed, still glowering at the floor. "It was a downpour and she forbid umbrellas."</p>
		<p>"Quite right." Cami gave an elegant nod to her thrall. "Being one with nature in such a manner is simply marvelous."</p>
		<p><mark>A while back, when discussing amenities, I had asked Cami whether it was true that vampires couldn't cross running water. She had laughed, then asked me in return, What constitutes running water? A river, a faucet, a rain drop? It was nearly impossible to take a step on land without crossing groundwater buried somewhere beneath its surface, she had informed me. No, the inability to cross running water was an old wives tale, or going with the theory that myths are borne of belief, not enough people believed in that particular weakness to make it a reality. Whichever the case, Cami was grateful, since she was fond of her showers and baths. And walking in the rain, apparently.</mark></p>
		<p>Jess brushed her wet bangs back in an attempt to stop them from dripping in her face. She shivered again. "My mistress forgets how it feels to be cold."</p>
		<p>The vampire blinked. "I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do." Cami looked at Jess, really looked at her, as if noticing her discomfort for the first time. Her brow crinkled in concern. "Do you suffer, my pet?"</p>
		<p>Jess's face turned crimson and she immediately looked away. "I'll be okay, mistress. Though I would like a change of clothes, soon. Please."</p>
		<p>"Do you need to excuse yourself for a change of wardrobe?" Cami asked.</p>
		<p>Jess looked like she desperately wanted to say yes, but then her eyes locked on me, a simple housemaster who was standing here innocently holding groceries and just trying to do his job, and she glared at me like I had nefarious plans for her mistress which I would put into action the moment that Cami and I left her sight. As if Cami couldn't ward off any unwanted advances herself by simply throwing me across the room using just one hand, or by snapping me in two using both. I doubted that Seoyun would stand by as I made a pass at Cami either, not that I planned to.</p>
		<p>Regardless, Jess turned back to Cami and, wearing a forced smile, she said, "I will stay. Thank you."</p>
		<p>Cami nodded to her and placed a delicate hand atop her thrall's head. Jess nuzzled her damp red hair against the palm of Cami's pale hand, like a puppy begging for pets, before she seemed to remember that she had an audience and she stopped herself. She did not pull away from the vampire's touch, however.</p>
		<p>From what I had been told, a powerful vampire such as Cami should be referred to as "master," not mistress, regardless of their gender. Despite using more intimate terms for one another, as far as I knew, Cami and Jess did not have an actual relationship. It looked like Jess may not have gotten that memo. I felt kind of bad for her. Though, with the way that she was glaring at me now, like a dog guarding its owner, maybe not that bad.</p>
		<p><mark>"You two should go change out of those wet clothes," I suggested. I was getting tired of holding these grocery bags, and I didn't need Jess to blame me for being miserable. "Besides, you don't want to be around when Vanessa discovers the giant puddle that you've made."</mark></p>
		<p><mark>I had meant it as a joke, but the two of them stilled at my words. Cami gave me a look, and I could see in her eyes that even the master vampire feared our housemaid. Then, Cami put her mask back in place and the look disappeared behind her patented elegant smile.</mark></p>
		<p><mark>"As you wish, housemaster. We shall make ourselves more presentable." She curtsied in her black gown that tried its best to cling to her. "Come, Jessamine."</mark></p>
		<p>As the two of them made their exit, Seoyun stood next to me and bumped my shoulder with hers. "You know, if you did invite Melody, your sister wouldn't have Jess as her only human friend."</p>
		<p>That made me look at her. "Do you consider Jess to be human?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun laughed. "She believes she is."</p>
		<p><mark>I wasn't sure what to say to that. If the two-hundred-or-whatever-year-old wall-crawling woman with the glowing eyes and car-lifting strength wanted to claim that she was still human, that was a level of denial that I had no interest in confronting.</mark></p>
		<p>We headed toward the doorway connecting the entryway to the main floor hallway, and Finola flew down from her perch on my head to hover before us. "You should invite Melody!" She flittered backward at eye level as we walked, practically vibrating with excitement at the prospect. "It'd be so fun to have another human to play with."</p>
		<p>"This place is meant to hide your existence from humans, and you want to open it to the public?" I asked.</p>
		<p>Seoyun clucked her tongue at me. "Not the public. Just Melody." Then she laughed. "If anything goes wrong, you know that the vampire can just make the girl forget all about us."</p>
		<p><mark>I frowned and grumbled. I hated that Cami could mesmerize people like that. How did I get so lucky as to be courted by two women with mind wipe abilities?</mark></p>
