<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>The church was ruined. Pews were tossed and destroyed. The nave was
covered in blood and broken bodies. In the center of this massacre were
a young man and woman.</p>
<p>Vincent stood above Katherine in the destroyed church. She sat
motionless on the pew and stared back up at him. He held out a hand to
her and she just stared at that as well.</p>
<p>"Come," Vincent said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Katherine accept his hand? (Answer,
Cooperation, Aggressiveness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [1, 2, 6] No. She is angry and doesn't want
to follow his lead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She slapped his hand away. "Leave me."</p>
<p>The two stood in silence among the bodies and ruin. Vincent waited
for Katherine to do or say anything, but she outlasted the vampire.</p>
<p>"We do not have time for this, Katherine. You can either walk beside
me, or I will carry you," he said.</p>
<p>She crossed her arms in a pout. "You will have to carry me then," the
young girl said in a huff.</p>
<p>Without a moment to waste, Vincent leaned forward and easily scooped
the blonde up into his arms. She let out a yelp of surprise and quickly
slung an arm around his neck for stability. He carried her out of the
church like a newly wed couple crossing the threshold.</p>
<p>He carried her like this down the street. He did his best to stick to
the shadows, primarily out of habit since the streets were nearly empty
and hiding was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Katherine rested her head against his chest. "Where are you taking
me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Someplace safe."</p>
<p>"Safe? I was safe in the church before you slaughtered the entire
clergy."</p>
<p>"That place was not safe. There are others looking for you. They
could not defend you."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and sighed. "Clearly not."</p>
<p>"I will protect you. Do not worry."</p>
<p>"I'm being delivered to an unknown destination by the monster that I
just watched kill my last remaining relative. Why should I worry?"</p>
<p>"You jest, but your uncle was a greater monster than I. That church
was diseased."</p>
<p>"My uncle, he.. well.. he didn't lay a hand on me, but I was always
afraid." She shuddered and instinctively nuzzled up deeper into
Vincent's chest. "I will not miss him."</p>
<p>Vincent remained silent. After a few moments, he pet her hair to
comfort her. He thought he could hear her sigh.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before they appeared before the run down trinket
store. As it was nearing the Christmas holiday, the store was stocked
with seasonal supplies and decorated with signs of the holiday. It was
nearly midnight and the store had long since closed. Vincent let himself
in.</p>
<p>After crossing the threshold with Katherine in his arms, he gently
lowered her to feet. "Follow me," he said and walked toward the back of
the room. He opened a door at the back of the shop and descended a set
of stairs.</p>
<p>Katherine hesitated to follow him. For a moment she considered
running but instead weighed her options. He was fast and would no doubt
catch her, likely before she even left the shop. Additionally, there was
allegedly another group out to get her and she couldn't guarantee that
they would treat her as kindly as Vincent had thus far--murder of
familial members aside.</p>
<p>'Better the devil you know,' she thought to herself and followed
Vincent down the stairs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it as expected? (Yes/And, Straight,
Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 6, 2] What I expected was a den full of
vampires, but instead it's completely vacant. It doesn't appear to be
dangerous though and Vincent's master is still here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Vincent walked down the hallway towards his master's room, it
became apparent that the place was empty. Bedroom doors were left ajar
and the dining area and rest area were vacant. He became suspicious of
whether his master was even here, but he knocked on the door nonetheless
and was invited in by a voice beyond the door.</p>
<p>Vincent entered with Katherine behind his back. He instinctively
shielded her, the state of the den putting his guard up.</p>
<p>The room was empty with the exception of his master who was seated at
her desk.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charlotte</strong> (Vincent's sire)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Killer</li>
<li>Descriptor: Amicable and Amusing</li>
<li>Traits: Lover, not a fighter; Stolid; Stoical</li>
<li>Goals: Take Wealthy; Persecute Success; Distress Servitude</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent and his master have a romantic
history? (Mixed, Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 3, 5] There is dramatic romantic tension
between the two and they may have slept together once or twice but they
are not a couple.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent's master consider him an equal?
(Answer, Curiosity, Cooperation)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [4, 6, 3] Yes and no. She has been
enthralled by him since he first met him as a mortal and has never
wanted him to leave her side, and so she would never treat him like a
lesser being, but at the same time she always makes sure he knows who
wears the pants in the relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Vincent, my sweet. You've returned," Charlotte said. She was leaned
back in her chair with her feet resting on her desk and her hands behind
her head.</p>
<p>"Yes. I have brought the girl as you've requested," he said.</p>
<p>"Excellent!" Charlotte clapped her hands together. "I trust there
were no difficulties?"</p>
<p>"There were complications, but nothing that I couldn't handle."</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and tried to read his face, something that she
always had trouble with. "Are we going to need a cleanup crew?"</p>
<p>He lowered his head. "I'm sorry, Master."</p>
<p>She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. "Quit with that 'master'
nonsense. You know I hate that."</p>
<p>"Yes, M--" he caught himself and repeated, "Yes."</p>
<p>Charlotte just rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Bring the girl here."</p>
<p>Vincent grabbed Katherine's wrist and together they crossed the room
to stand before Charlotte. In the blink of an eye Charlotte had moved
from the prone resting position in her chair to perched at the edge of
her desk.</p>
<p>"Ooh, she's pretty. Not prettier than me, I hope?" Charlotte shot a
sidewise glance at Vincent with a smirk.</p>
<p>"When compared with your beauty, all are like a candle and you are
the sun," Vincent said in a monotone rehearsed manner.</p>
<p>Charlotte playfully pushed his shoulder. "You dork."</p>
<p>Katherine looked back and forth between the two. She was starting to
feel more uncomfortable about their interactions than the fact that she
was standing in a vampire den.</p>
<p>"If I may ask," Vincent began, "where is everyone? Why are we
alone?"</p>
<p>"Are you afraid to be alone with me, Vincent?" Charlotte waggled her
eyebrows in a playfully seductive manner. She was met with Vincent's
blank stare. "Gah. You're no fun." She threw her hands up and pushed
herself off the desk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are they alone?<br />
<strong>Why:</strong> [Connected Bureaucracy] The other members voted
her out, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What'd she do wrong?<br />
<strong>What:</strong> [Lineage of World] They are upset about her
favoring Vincent all of the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She paced around the office. "You want to know why we're alone? They
left me, Vincent. Left <em>us</em>. They're gone and we were discarded
like trash."</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"You, honestly." She looked at Vincent like she could burst into
tears any second. "Or rather, it was my treatment of you. It's no secret
that you're my favorite. The others got tired of my favoritism. They
said"--she dropped into a lower octave and put her hands on her
hips--"'It's either him or us.'" She sighed. "It was never a choice. It
was always going to be you."</p>
<p>"Charlotte... I don't know what to say." Vincent said.</p>
<p>She just shook her head. "There's nothing to say. I'm weak. You make
me weak. But I don't even care. It's better this way."</p>
<p>The room went quiet. Vincent and Charlotte were trapped in their
heads with what-ifs and what-may-have-beens.</p>
<p>Awkwardly, Katherine broke the silence. "Excuse me, but why am I
here?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Select:</strong> She's here because..</p>
<ul>
<li>she possesses a skill (1-2)</li>
<li>she knows something (3-4)</li>
<li><strong>her blood is special (5-7) [5]</strong></li>
<li>she has political importance (8)</li>
<li>she has religious importance (9)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Select:</strong> What is special about her blood?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Aged Bad guy] It can revive someone. (1-3)
[3]</strong></li>
<li>[Attention of Crush] It is addictive. (4)</li>
<li>[Attainment of Catastrophe] It can cure a vampire disease. (5)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Revive who?<br />
<strong>Who:</strong> [Demonically Feisty] Charlotte's sire,
Corinna.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corinna</strong> (Charlotte's sire)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Witch</li>
<li>Descriptor: Plucky and Unassuming</li>
<li>Other Traits: Traitorous; Involved; Guileless</li>
<li>Goals: Win affection; Shepherd Lust; Strive Pleasure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte tell her why she's here? (Answer,
Motivation, Directness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [3, 3, 6] She tells Katherine why she's
needed but omits how she's needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You," Charlotte said as she spun to face Katherine with a grin, "are
going to help me wake my sire! I'm so excited!"</p>
<p>"I'm what?"</p>
<p>Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Wake Corinna? But she was sealed away for
being a traitor, wasn't she?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did Charlotte ever tell Vincent the story of
Corinna? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Sympathy)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 2, 3] She did, but she only gave the vaguest
of details, so Vincent has a difficult time understanding what Charlotte
is thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"It's complicated. I know you've mostly heard only rumors, but you'll
have to trust me."</p>
<p>"Of course I trust you," Vincent said without missing a beat.</p>
<p>"Then you have nothing to worry about," Charlotte said with a large
grin. "This is going to be great!"</p>
<p>"But Master, why revive her now?"</p>
<p>She leaned back against her desk. "Well, I originally requested that
you retrieve this girl so that I could revive--or perhaps only threaten
to revive--Corinna for leverage. I could feel the tide turning against
us, so I decided to use my trump card." She shrugged with an exasperated
smile. "But I guess it's too late for that. I misjudged how eager they
were to abandon us."</p>
<p>"Okay, but if the opportunity has passed, then why still revive
her?"</p>
<p>"This place is a dump, Vincent. Don't you agree? This dingy basement
below a Christmas shoppe."</p>
<p>Vincent looked around the room and shrugged. He had taken residence
in places much worse than this.</p>
<p>"It's a dump," Charlotte reaffirmed. "I want out. If we no longer
have to concern ourselves with a coven then there is no reason to stay
here. We can return to traveling the world again. Remember how life used
to be? Just you and I with nothing to hold us down."</p>
<p>He nodded. He did remember and had fond memories of those times. "And
Corinna?"</p>
<p>"I can't leave her, Vincent." She sighed. "I could accept her being
sealed when she was just right over there," she waved her arm
haphazardly in the directly of the other coven, "but I can't leave town
with her like that. I can't abandon her, regardless of what the charges
are against her."</p>
<p>"A jailbreak then?" he asked.</p>
<p>She gave a devilish grin. "A jailbreak."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is Katherine accepting all of this? (Answer,
Curiosity, Cooperation)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [6, 2, 1] She is okay with going along with
what they're suggesting since she basically has nothing else now, but
she also doesn't have any personal interest in what Charlotte wants and
doesn't intend to be proactive at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katherine sat in Charlotte's desk chair. "That all sounds great. I
hope you enjoy yourselves. I'll be waiting here until you get back."</p>
<p>Charlotte chuckled. "You silly girl, you're coming with us. We need
you on site to revive Corinna. Not to mention that you'll undoubtedly
run the moment you leave our sight."</p>
<p>Katherine frowned. The thought had obviously crossed her mind, but
where would she even go?</p>
<p>"Should we attack tonight?" Vincent asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should they? (Answer, Motivation,
Directness)<br />
<strong>Character:</strong> [2, 2, 5] Nope. Charlotte isn't in the
mood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte sighed in such a manner that she resembled a deflating
balloon. "Not tonight, please. It's been a trying night and Corinna can
stand to hibernate one more day. Tonight I want cuddles."</p>
<p>"Cuddles," Vincent repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes! With the coven gone, I no longer need to pretend that you are
just another clan member. I apparently wasn't very good at hiding it
anyway, but now I can dote on you to my heart's content. And so:
cuddles." She grinned at Vincent like a child on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>"I see. Cuddles it is then."</p>
<p>Katherine rose from her seat. "Right, well, have fun. It's after
midnight and I'm going to sleep."</p>
<p>"I don't think so, Missy," Charlotte said with her hands on her hips.
"You're staying up with us. We can't have you passing out from sleep
deprivation in the middle of our raid tomorrow. You'll sleep when we do
to sync your schedule."</p>
<p>She groaned. "Fine. But can you at least start a fire? It's freezing
in here and I'm not cold blooded like you are."</p>
<p>And so the three of them passed the night away in front of the
fireplace, which was actually the boiler in the basement. Vincent and
Charlotte sat on a couch, Charlotte draped herself all over Vincent, and
they conversed all night.</p>
<p>Katherine sat in a separate chair and keep quiet. Every time she
began to nod off, Charlotte poked her cheek with her finger.</p>
<p>Eventually the sun rose, at which time Charlotte sealed Katherine
away in a storage room furnished with a cot. Charlotte returned to her
bedroom, dragging Vincent with her. She snuggled up to Vincent as they
drifted off to sleep in her bed.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the next scene as expected? (Yes/And,
Straight, Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [6, 6, 6, Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the
Big Bad or other forces aligned against the main characters and their
interests] I expected the characters to sneak into the castle, and I
expected it to be dangerous, but it's made worse because the members
that left Charlotte's coven have joined this one and are expecting
her.</p>
<ul>
<li>Castle

</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte and company arrived at the castle just after nightfall.
Rather than approaching the gate, the group traversed to the darkest
corner of the castle wall. The castle walls may keep out humans but they
were nothing to vampires.</p>
<p>Katherine latched onto Vincent's back with her arms wrapped tightly
around his shoulders. Charlotte gave side-eyed looks from apparent
jealousy, but there wasn't any other way to get the human over the
wall.</p>
<p>The cobblestone walls of the castle provided convenient handholds and
Vincent and Charlotte quickly ascended to the top of the wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a lookout at the top? (Mixed, Straight,
Favorability)<br />
<strong>Story</strong> [3, 2, 4] Not here at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They couldn't be sure that there weren't guards posted at other
stations along the castle wall, but they were fortunate enough to select
an unguarded section of the wall. They were safe for now.</p>
<p>The trio descended the near stairs and entered the castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte know where she's going? (Mixed,
Straight, Favorability)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 3, 2] Sort of. She's only heard rumors, so
she only has a general idea where Corinna might be held, and she isn't
even sure if it's good intel.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [5+0, 4+0] Hallway and guards.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte spot them first?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [5,2,6] = 11
(d6)<br />
<strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8 + Alertness d10 + Duty
d8 + Vampire d10: [4,10,7,5] = 17 (d10) + Heroic Success</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Charlotte immediately spotted
a pair of guards at the end of the hallway. Thankfully they didn't spot
her as well and she managed to sneak into the doorway off to the side.
She turned back and waved the others on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent make it?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [4,6,6] = 12
(d8)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8 + Agility d6 + Duty d10 + Vampire
d8: [4,4,1,5] = 13 (d4) + Hitch; Spent 1 PP to keep extra die and had to
take d4 effect die.<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> What is the hitch?<br />
<strong>What:</strong> [Witnessed Information] The guard saw evidence of
entry; bought for 1 PP. It'll be a "Suspicious d6" complication if they
come back through this hallway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Katherine make it?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [5,6,5] = 11
(d8)<br />
<strong>Katherine:</strong> Blood Sacrifice d8 + Agility d8 + Glory d4:
[8,4,2] = 12 (d4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three of them sneaked past the guard but Vincent bumped an end
table on the way out and it caught the guard's attention. The trio were
already long gone, but the guard had become suspicious and going back
this way would be difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [3+1,1+1] Expected location and no
encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next room that they entered was empty. It was a fairly
nondescript room with nothing of interest so they continued through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [2+2,4+2] Expected location and no
encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following room appeared to be more of the same. Charlotte was
beginning to wonder if she actually knew where she was going. Perhaps
she had bad intel after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [1+3,5+3] Expected location and friendly
encounter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Margaret</strong> (Blood Mage)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Wizard</li>
<li>Descriptor: Longing For The Younger Years and Striking</li>
<li>Traits: Frightened; Exacting; Unaware of own limitations</li>
<li>Goals: Execute Poverty; Convey Propaganda; Oppress others</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does she look?<br />
<strong>Adjective:</strong> [Powerfully Fiery] She has bright red hair
that stands out against her pale skin. She's very beautiful and exudes a
sense of power from her presence.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is she as expected? (Mixed, Straight,
Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 1, 6] I expected Margeret to be friendly
towards Vincent rather than Charlotte, which would make her jealous. The
oracle agrees and sets the drama level to high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if to answer her concerns, the next turn led them straight into a
command room, not unlike her own. In it was a desk and behind it stood
Margaret.</p>
<p>The red-haired woman appeared to have been glancing over some
documents on their arrival, but her head snapped up to spot them the
moment that they appeared.</p>
<p>"Why, if it isn't my lovely Vincent. How are you, my sweet?" The
voluptuous woman gracefully skirted around the desk and latched onto his
arm. Margaret beamed at him but then her smile withered into a grimace
once she glanced over his shoulder. "Oh. I see your keeper tagged along
as well."</p>
<p>"Hello, Margaret," Charlotte said flatly and unamused.</p>
<p>Margaret ignored Charlotte and returned her attention to Vincent. "I
haven't seen you in ages. What brings you to my humble lair?"</p>
<p>"We came to retrieve something of ours," Vincent said
matter-of-factly. Charlotte gasped at how he showed their hand.</p>
<p>Margaret rubbed her cheek on Vincent's shoulder like a kitten.
"Something? Or some<em>one</em>?" she asked, peering up at him to search
his face.</p>
<p>When he didn't answer she just sighed. "Why her? Corinna has been
ours for decades and you only just now come to her rescue. What
changed?"</p>
<p>"If you must know," Charlotte said as she stepped forward and gave
Margaret a light shove to separate her from Vincent, "we are leaving
this city and we're not leaving her behind."</p>
<p>Margaret giggled and let Charlotte push her away, happy to have
gotten the reaction that she was looking for.</p>
<p>"Do you know where she is?" Vincent asked Margaret.</p>
<p>"Hmmm.. I don't know. Do I?" the red-head feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>"Margaret. Please," Vincent said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can he convince Margaret?<br />
<strong>Margaret:</strong> 2d8 + Sucker for Vincent d4: [5,2,2] = 7
(d4)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Servant d8 + Willpower d10 + Duty d10:
[6,1,10] = 16 (d4) + Heroic Success + Hitch<br />
<strong>Hitch:</strong> Margaret demands to tag along; bought for 1
PP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was quiet for a minute, as if weighing her options, and then a
smile crept across her face. "I will show you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'show us'?" Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>"I will guide you." Margaret glomped onto Vincent's arm. "After all,
I can't let my Vinciepoo fall into a trap, can I? I would worry so!"</p>
<p>Charlotte narrowed her eyes. "Lead the way, tramp."</p>
<p>Margaret cackled as she practically dragged Vincent out of the room
by his elbow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do they make it to Corinna without incident?
(Mixed, Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 5, 6] They manage to avoid any suspicion,
but Charlotte has had about enough of Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does the room look like?<br />
<strong>Descriptor:</strong> [Perfectly Lonely] The room contains only
Corinna and not much else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The group traveled through the castle, following Margaret's lead.
Charlotte was loath to admit it, but having Margaret declare their path
was crucial, since she not only knew the exact location Corinna, but
also the location of all guard patrols. They didn't meet a soul on their
way to where Corinna was sealed.</p>
<p>"Well, this is drab," Charlotte said upon arriving as their
destination.</p>
<p>The room was a dark holding cell. There was absolutely nothing to see
other than an elaborately decorated coffin in the center of the
room.</p>
<p>"A coffin? I thought those were just fiction," Katherine said.</p>
<p>"They <em>are</em> fiction. Vanessa thinks that she's being cute,"
Charlotte said while grimacing at Margaret. Margaret just smiled and
shrugged.</p>
<p>Vincent stepped toward the box. "Right. So, how do we do this?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How <em>are</em> they going to do this?<br />
<strong>How:</strong> [Reception of Magic] Margaret magically charges
Katherine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Well, we need Katherine, first of all," Charlotte began, "and then
we need a touch of magic. I was going to attempt the act myself since
Corinna has taught me a little bit of sorcerery, buuut...," she turned
to Margaret, "we have had the fortune of being graced with our very one
blood mage. Haven't we, dear?"</p>
<p>Margaret laughed. "Oh, please. You know that I have the skill, but
it's going to take more than the blood of a virgin to wake your precious
Corinna."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How is Katherine's blood special?<br />
<strong>How:</strong> [Kill Ancestor] She's related to Vanessa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I know," Charlotte said.</p>
<p>"I don't think you do. This wasn't just any spell that put her under;
the spell was tied to Vanessa's blood. You can't break the seal without
it."</p>
<p>"That's incorrect. It was tied to her bloodline, not her blood."</p>
<p>"Sure, but Vanessa is a vampire. She doesn't have descendants."</p>
<p>Charlotte grinned like the cat that got the cream. "Wrong again!"</p>
<p>Margaret was quiet as she took this in.</p>
<p>"Vanessa had a child?" she finally asked.</p>
<p>Charlotte shrugged. "Seems like." Then she waved her arm in the
directly of Katherine. "Allow me to introduce you to the last living
descendant of Vanessa."</p>
<p>Margaret turned her attention the young blonde and looked her up and
down.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but who is Vanessa?" Katherine asked, shrinking back from
Margaret's scrutinizing gaze.</p>
<p>"She's our princess," Margaret answered. "She rules our coven."</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed. "<em>Your</em> coven? You leech."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Margaret waved a hand in dismissal. "They provide room
and board in exchange for my services. I may not be a vampire, but this
is the closest thing I've had to a home since... well.. you know."</p>
<p>Charlotte glared. "Yes, I know."</p>
<p>Vincent coughed. "Right then. Can we do this now?"</p>
<p>Margaret sighed. "Yeah, fine." She turned to Katherine. "Girl, hold
your wrist out over the coffin."</p>
<p>Katherine gulped but complied. She held her delicate wrist directly
above a golden rose emblazoned on the lid of the coffin. Margaret held
Katherine's wrist with in hand and broke her pale skin with the
thumbnail of her other. Katherine hissed at the sharp pain.</p>
<p>Margaret whisped words in an ancient language as blood trickled from
Katherine's wrist and pooled on the rose. It traveled along the grooves
of the intricate engraving. When the petals had been outlined by
Katherine's blood, the blood glowed softly and the lid popped with a
gentle click.</p>
<p>"Wow... It's true," Margaret said as she looked at Katherine once
more.</p>
<p>Katherine took her arm back and held her wrist, putting pressure on
the wound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Corinna wake immediately? (Yes/And,
Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [6, 6, 5; Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the
Big Bad or other forces aligned against the main characters and their
interests.] Oops. Yeah, she's awake and pissed. She also manages to
alert the guards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the sound of splintering wood, a small fist thrust up through
the lid of the coffin, snapped it in two, and blew it off its hinges.
The coffin was vacated faster than even Charlotte could see and that
small hand held Margaret against the wall by her throat. Margaret's feet
kicked as she dangled and grasped at her throat, trying to pry Corinna's
steel grip from her trachea.</p>
<p>"Betrayer!" Corinna shouted with a guttural growl. The petite vampire
radiated power and fury. Magically charged currents circled her,
whipping her long black hair, through which peered eyes that glittered
gold in the light.</p>
<p>"Cor--" was all Margaret could get out before Corinna squeezed
tighter and cut off any ability to speak.</p>
<p>"I should kill you right now," Corinna hissed.</p>
<p>Vincent spoke up. "Corinna. Margaret is the one that freed you."</p>
<p>Corinna whipped her head toward Vincent and glared intensely. Without
looking, she pushed Margaret harder against the wall, causing her to
whimper. Corinna then turned to Charlotte. "Is this true?"</p>
<p>Charlotte shrugged and sighed. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>Corinna returned her gaze to Margaret. The red-head's struggling was
becoming slow and clumsy. She looked like she was about to pass out.
Corinna observed her, still seething with rage. Then as Margaret's eyes
were beginning to roll back into her head, Corinna opened her palm wide
and let the woman fall to the ground in a heap.</p>
<p>Katherine had hid behind Vincent and watched the violent display.
Unconsciously she whispered to herself, "She's just a little
girl..."</p>
<p>"Who's a little girl?" Corinna's voice came from just behind her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Katherine froze.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does she panic? (Mixed, Straight, Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [1, 4, 3] She keeps her cool and manages to not
provoke Corinna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Whats the matter?" the voice of the child whispered into her ear, so
close that her breath tickled. "Are you frightened of a <em>little
girl</em>?"</p>
<p>Katherine remained silent and motionless.</p>
<p>Corinna sniffed her. "You smell amazing. Do you know that?" she
asked. Katherine only whimpered in reply.</p>
<p>"Corinna, dear. You don't want that one," Charlotte said.</p>
<p>Corinna frowned. "Why not?"</p>
<p>"This is Vanessa's descendant."</p>
<p>"Ha..!" A laugh caught in Corinna's throat. Then she laughed like a
mad woman. Her laughter echoed off the walls.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a pair of patrolling guards heard her laughter down
the hall and ran into the room to check the disturbance. One of the men
spotted the broken coffin and immediately darted out of the room and
around the corner. Seconds later the sound of something like a church
bell rang out.</p>
<p>Corinna chuckled to herself and wiped tears of laughter from her
eyes. Charlotte shook her shoulders. "Cor, we need to go. Now."</p>
<p>The small vampire looked over her shoulder at her kindred, then at
the guards piling into the room. "Yes. I suppose it's that time."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many guards are there? (2d6)<br />
<strong>Roll:</strong> [7] A mob of 4d8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent jumped in front of the girls, putting himself between them
and the guards. He bared his fangs and claws. The guards unsheathed
their swords and pounced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 4d8: [4, 8, 8, 2] = 16 (d8)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8, Agility d6, Duty d10, Brawling
d10, Vampire 2d10: [4, 1, 2, 2, 5, 6] = 16 (d10) + Hitch; Spent 1 PP to
double Vampire and 1 PP to keep an extra die<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> The guard gives Vincent the "Wounded d6"
complication (stepped down).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent grabbed at the hilts of their swords to prevent their
attacks. With the flick of his wrist, he flipped one of the guards off
their feet and drove them into the wall with his shoulder. A third guard
gave him a shallow slash across his back while it was turned, but he
managed to spin and avoid the worst of it.</p>
<p>At the sight of Vincent being wounded, Charlotte leaped at the guards
like a rabid dog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlotte:</strong> Hopeless Romantic d8, Strength d6, Love
d10, Vampire 2d10: [8, 1, 9, 4, 1] = 17 (d10) + 2 Hitches; Spent 1 PP to
double Vampire<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 4d8: [1, 4, 5, 8] = 13 (d8) + Opportunity<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. Bought the hitches for 1
PP and started a "Vanessa is Coming" timed test with 5 beats. (Beats
will only decrease on PC actions.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte bowled over three of the guards, knocking them to the
ground. She stood on the chest of one of them and gripped onto their
skull. With a scream she ripped the guard's head clear off its
shoulders. Blood sprayed and covered the two prone guards.</p>
<p>One of the downed guards scrambled to his feet and fled the room in a
panic. He yelled for Vanessa at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>At the back of the room, Katherine had backed herself into a corner.
She was not a fighter and this was way too much for her. Even though she
attempted to make herself small, she had still managed to draw the
attention of a guard. They made a move to grab her. Margaret spotted
this from across the room and performed a hand motion that sent a wave
of energy toward the guard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 3d8: [2, 7, 3] = 10 (d8)<br />
<strong>Margaret:</strong> 2d8 + Blood Mage d10: [1, 5, 8] = 13 (d4) +
Hitch<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Margaret stops the guard. Bought the hitch for
1 PP to use an extra beat, leaving the countdown at 4 beats
remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret's spell caused the blood in the guard to heat. Their attack
was halted by the pain, but only momentarily.</p>
<p>Corinna watched this transpire and knew that she had to keep
Katherine alive. She was on the guard before anyone could see her move
from her position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Traitor d8, Strength d12, Power d10,
Celerity d10, Vampire d12: [8, 5, 10, 9, 3] = 19 (d12)<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 3d8: [1, 3, 8]= 11 (d4) + Opportunity<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. The heroic success keeps
the countdown at 4 beats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corinna sunk her claws into the guard's spine and with an effortless
motion she tore the guard's torso in two. Katherine, while safe, was
covered in gore and began shrieking. Corinna threw the two halves of the
guard against opposite walls and then took care to brush off her
dress.</p>
<p>In a panic, Katherine dashed past Corinna and beelined for the door.
She could barely see with the blood in her eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katherine's action uses a beat, leaving the countdown at 3.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Margaret stop her? (Yes/And, Straight,
Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 4, 3] She stops her without putting herself
in too bad of a position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret reached out and hooked an arm around Katherine's waist as
she ran by. The mage then slammed Katherine into the wall. "Stay," she
commanded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vincent and Charlotte were locked in combat with the
remaining guards near the doorway. They had taken out a good number of
them already and they littered the floor.</p>
<p>The guard facing off against Charlotte swung frantically at her with
their sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8: [2, 5] = 7 (d4)<br />
<strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8, Agility d12, Duty d8,
Vampire d10: [6, 9, 7, 3] = 16 (d10)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Charlotte dodges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte easily dodged the weapon and pushed the guard way with a
thrust of her arm. At the same time, another guard lunged at
Vincent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8 + Wounded d6 (Vincent): [4, 7, 2] = 11
(d6)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8, Agility d6, Duty d10, Brawling
d10, Vampire d8: [1, 5, 5, 1, 8] = 13 (d10) + 2 Hitches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent caught the guard by the arm and used their own weight against
them, tossing them to the ground. Charlotte dashed after her attacker
and leapt at them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8, Strength d6, Power
d6, Vampire 2d10: [7, 5, 2, 9, 3] = 16 (d10); Spent 1 PP to double
Vampire<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8: 12 (d4)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. The countdown drops to 2
beats remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte knocked the guard off balance and pinned them to the
ground. Like a cobra strike she reached into the guard's chest and
yanked out their heart. They screamed before collapsing.</p>
<p>"This is taking too long," Corinna said from behind Vincent and
Charlotte. She calmly walked up to the prone guard and struck at them
with an axe kick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Cold d8, Strength d12, Power d10, Vampire
d12: [3, 5, 5, 6] = 11 (d12)<br />
<strong>Guard:</strong> d8: [8] = 8 (d4)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> The last guard is taken out. The countdown
drops to 1 beat remaining but is stopped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heel of the small vampire sliced cleanly through the guard's neck
and cracked the floor below. Corinna retracted her foot and shook it,
grimacing at the gore that clung to it.</p>
<p>"We need to leave. Vanessa will be here any second," said
Margaret.</p>
<p>Charlotte put her hands on her hips. "What? You think that you're
joining us?"</p>
<p>"We can discuss this outside," Vincent said.</p>
<p>Corinna was already walking toward the door as she said "Agreed. I've
spent long enough in this place."</p>
