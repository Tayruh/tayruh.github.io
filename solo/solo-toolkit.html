					"NONE": "Leave this Plot Point blank and go on to the next Plot Point, unless it would leave you with fewer than 2 Plot Points in this Turning Point, in which case re-roll.",
					"INTO THE UNKNOWN": "This Turning Point involves Characters entering a situation with unknown factors. To know the unknown, you have to commit to it. For instance, a magic portal where there is no way of knowing what’s on the other side except by walking through it. Or, you discover a machine that is very powerful but you have no idea what it does, except if you turn it on. The only way to discover the unknown is to engage it, when it will be too late if you regret it.",
					"A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED IN A NON-LETHAL WAY": "A Character is attacked, but the assailant will not attack to kill.",
					"A NEEDED RESOURCE RUNS OUT": "A resource a Character needs has run out. The lack will cause problems. For instance, traveling a dinosaur filled jungle and running out of ammunition.",
					"USEFUL INFORMATION FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE": "A Character receives useful information from an anonymous source. Perhaps a note is found laying on your doorstep, or an email appears in your inbox with a photo that reveals something to the Character. Whatever the information is, it should impact the Plotline.",
					"IMPENDING DOOM": "Something terrible is going to happen, and it is approaching. For instance, an enemy army is advancing to invade and will be at the borders in a week.",
					"OUTCAST": "A Character is considered an outcast by other Characters for some reason. Maybe the Character is part of an ethnic group that is disliked in the area, or perhaps the Character is popularly believed to be the perpetrator of a heinous crime.",
					"PERSUASION": "A Character tries to persuade another Character to do something. This persuasion can take many forms, from pleading with them to threatening them, for instance.",
					"A MOTIVE FREE CRIME": "A crime is committed either in this Turning Point or is learned about in this Turning Point, with no clear reason why the crime was committed. Maybe someone was murdered for no obvious reason, or a building was broken into with nothing stolen.",
					"COLLATERAL DAMAGE": "Whatever is going on in this Turning Point, the activity will spill over from the focus of that activity to things around it. This is particularly true for damaging events. For instance, a superhero defeats a villain in a downtown brawl, but doing significant damage to the buildings around them in the process. The collateral damage does not have to be physical. For instance, it could be the legal fallout from a major court decision.",
					"SHADY PLACES": "This Turning Point involves a location that is less than legitimate, such as a back alley where drug deals are commonly transacted or a secret gambling hall in a bar.",
					"A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED IN A LETHAL WAY": "An assailant is trying to kill a Character.",
					"DO IT, OR ELSE": "A Character is being given a task, and is being pressured into completing the task with a threat. For instance, a spy is forcing a diplomat to hand over technology secrets or he will expose the diplomat’s illegal activities and send him to jail.

					"AMBUSH": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves sudden action at an unexpected time.",
					"SOLD!": "This Turning Point involves a sale of some kind. Maybe goods are being sold, or information is being bought. Whatever is happening, goods and money are exchanging hands.",
					"CATASTROPHE": "Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen, and it happens spectacularly and with much action. This could be the impregnable fortress that gets sacked, the unstoppable superhero who gets defeated, the unsinkable ship that starts to sink.",

					"CHARACTER HAS A CLEVER IDEA": "A Character has an idea that has an impact on this Turning Point. For instance, the con man speaks up and just happens to know a secret way through the sewers into the walled city.",
					"SOMETHING IS GETTING AWAY": "This Turning Point involves a time limit where, at the end of it, something will get away. For instance, a ship carrying a magic artifact is about to leave the dock and a Character has to fight their way through a pack of armed goons to board the ship before it sets sail.",
					"RETALIATION": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, it involves an element of retaliation or revenge.",

					"HUNTED": "A Character is being hunted by someone or something that is not strictly legitimate. In other words, as opposed to Wanted By The Law, Hunted may mean a hit man is pursuing a Character to fulfill a mafia contract on them, or a ghost may be after a Character. The hunter doesn’t have to be seeking to kill.",
					"A HIGH ENERGY GATHERING": "This Turning Point involves a social gathering with a great deal of energy or activity. This could be a busy nightclub, a loud party, or a sporting event, for instance.",
					"A RARE OR UNIQUE SOCIAL GATHERING": "This is a social gathering for a specific and rare purpose. Examples would include funerals or a wedding.",
					"BAD DECISION": "A decision a Character made has turned out to be a very bad one. This can be a decision made earlier in the Adventure, or it can be something from before the Adventure. This earlier decision may not have seemed like a bad one at the time, but it has turned out to be bad, either for the Character, for others, or both. For instance, maybe a ship’s captain decided to investigate a distress beacon in deep space, only to find it’s a trap laid by pirates.",
					"THIS ISN’T WORKING": "Something that is supposed to be working is not for some reason, causing a problem. For instance, a binding spell is failing to hold a demon, or a crime boss is delivering stolen goods through a shipping port that is supposed to be secure but turns out to be swarming with police. Whatever isn’t working is something that was assumed would work.",
					"DISTRACTION": "A Character is distracted in this Turning Point in such a way that it impacts events. For instance, before a villain delivers his killing blow he’s distracted by an image of his lost love, giving the hero time to escape.",
					"ILL WILL": "A Character harbors ill will toward another Character for some reason. The animosity should be deep seated and color the Character’s reactions when it comes to the unliked Character. The dislike may be reciprocated or not.",
					"AN ORGANIZATION": "This Turning Point involves an organization of some kind. This can be an organization already in the Characters List or not. Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, the organization is formally involved in some way. For instance, a crime has been committed and a local guild had knowledge of it and covered it up to protect its own interests.",
					"WANTED BY THE LAW": "A Character is wanted for a crime. It doesn’t matter if they actually did the crime, but the law is after them as the main suspect either way.",
					"A RESOURCE DISAPPEARS": "An important object or resource is stolen by an unknown thief. The resource should be something either useful to a Character, or it should pertain to the Plotline in question.",
					"IT IS YOUR DUTY": "A Character is charged with carrying out a duty. This should be something that the Character has little choice in the matter, whether they want to do it or not. Whoever the duty is coming from, that source has authority over the Character. For instance, a soldier wants to join in the pivotal battle but his commander gives him the duty of guarding the fortress gate instead.",
					"FORTUITOUS FIND": "A Character runs across something very useful for resolving the Plotline. This may be a piece of information, a useful tool, a resource that is needed, a person who can help, etc. Whatever it is, it’s the right thing at the right time, and it falls into the Character’s lap.",
					"CHARACTER CONNECTION SEVERED": "A Character who has a connection with another Character severs that connection. This can happen for any of a number of reasons, from the Character dropping out of the story to the Character getting angry at the other Character for something. The severed connection does not have to be permanent.",
					"ALL IS REVEALED!": "A source in this Turning Point gives a lot of detail about something. For instance, a guard is captured and tells where the king has hidden the Sacred Scrolls.",
					"HUMILIATION": "This Turning Point involves a Character being humiliated or facing humiliation. Whatever is happening, it should be something deeply embarrassing to the Character. For instance, a member of an unpopular community is being bullied and mocked, or a public figure has something personal publicly exposed.",
					"PEOPLE BEHAVING BADLY": "This Turning Point involves someone behaving in a socially unacceptable way. For example, a group of drunks throwing bottles, or a heckler in a crowd yelling at a speaker.",
					"USEFUL INFORMATION FROM A KNOWN SOURCE": "A Character acquires useful information from a known source. For instance, a detective investigating a homicide gets a tip from an informant she sometimes uses, giving her a clue.",
					"CRYPTIC INFORMATION FROM A KNOWN SOURCE": "A Character acquires information that is not immediately useful from a known source. The information is cryptic, the Character doesn’t know what it means. For instance, a crewmember leaves behind a note to be found that simply says, “Kraton,” where the Character receiving the note has no idea what “Kraton” is.",
					"LIE DISCOVERED": "This Turning Point involves the discovery of a lie. The lie could have happened within this Turning Point, or it could have happened earlier in the Adventure or even before the Adventure. For instance, Characters may learn that the detective did not destroy the cult artifact like he said he did, but instead took it home to try and summon the Beast From Beyond.",
					"A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED TO ABDUCT": "An assailant is attempting to abduct a Character.",
					"SOMETHING EXOTIC": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it involves an unusual or exotic element. For instance, if the Turning Point is about someone being attacked by an assassin, the assassin may have a very unusual identity or mode of attack (maybe he’s disguised as a clown and attacks with exploding balloons, or he is a martial artist with fantastic moves).",
					"IMMEDIATELY": "Immediate action is required in this Turning Point, whatever is going on. For instance, if this Turning Point involves engine failure on a starship, the Character doesn’t have days to resolve the issue, he may only have an hour. Whatever is going on, it requires immediate action.",
					"FAME": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves someone famous to some extent. This doesn’t necessarily mean that a famous Character is Invoked, just that the Turning Point has some connection to fame. For instance, if this Turning Point involves learning a secret about another Character, you may learn that they were once a member of a famous superhero group decades ago.",
					"CHASE": "This Turning Point involves a chase, where one Character is pursuing another.",
					"BETRAYAL!": "A Character, who was thought to be an ally or to be benign, turns on another Character. This can be a fundamental betrayal, such as they are actually on opposing sides, or it can be a momentary betrayal, such as attacking someone out of a fit of anger.",
					"A CRIME IS COMMITTED": "A crime is committed either in this Turning Point or is learned about in this Turning Point.",
					"A CHARACTER IS INCAPACITATED": "A Character is rendered out of commission for some reason. Perhaps they are wounded badly, they lose their powers, are trapped somewhere, etc.",
					"IT’S A SECRET": "This Turning Point involves an activity that is done in secret, such as smuggling or embezzlement. The activity doesn’t have to be illegal, but whatever it is, it is something hidden or being done behind an otherwise legitimate front. For instance, a fast food chain is using it’s delivery trucks to smuggle drugs across the border.",
					"SOMETHING LOST HAS BEEN FOUND": "Something that has been lost turns up in this Turning Point. The thing could have been lost in this Adventure or before. It can be an object, a person, or anything. For instance, a ring of power suddenly turns up in a creek bed, or a Character who disappeared early in the Adventure suddenly makes a reappearance.",
					"SCAPEGOAT": "This Turning Point involves an innocent Character accused of wrongdoing to throw suspicion off of the real culprit. For instance, the woman who took all the ammo blames the newcomer to the zombie survivalist group, or the mayor of the little New England town blames the practitioners of a religion for the bizarre events going on when he is actually at fault.",
					"NOWHERE TO RUN": "A Character faces a peril with no means to escape.",
					"AT NIGHT": "This Turning Point takes place at night.",
					"THE OBSERVER": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point that is presumed to be private from someone, is actually being witnessed or observed. The observed are not aware of this observer. For instance, two enemy generals are meeting in secret to form an alliance and betray their respective kings, but the meeting is observed by a princess who knows exactly what it means.",
					"ESCAPE": "This Turning Point involves an escape of some sort. For instance, a Character who was captured by brigands in an earlier Turning Point manages to slip away from his captors and escape into the forest.",
					"A SECRET WEAPON": "This Turning Point involves the reveal of a secret weapon in possession by a Character. This weapon should be significant enough to sway the balance of power or to otherwise require a solution to resolve. For instance, the motley band of orcs is unexpectedly backed by a large ogre whose aid they enlisted. Or, the galactic empire unveils a new, planet-busting warship that changes everything",
					"HEAVILY GUARDED": "This Turning Point involves entering a heavily guarded and dangerous location. For instance, this could be needing to infiltrate a high tech security facility to steal information, or breaking into the necromancers lair full of guardian zombies to destroy his magic crystal.",
					"RESCUE": "A Character needs to be rescued in this Turning Point.",
					"LIAR!": "This Turning Point involves an active lie. The lie is being committed in this Turning Point. Something someone said or claimed is false. For instance, a vampire lord claims he knows nothing of a magic book, when actually he is seeking it himself. The lie may or may not be detected in this Turning Point.",
					"HOME SWEET HOME": "This Turning Point takes place in the private home of a Character.",
					"A CHARACTER ACTS OUT OF CHARACTER": "A Character does something that runs counter to that Character’s perceived goals or personality. The action may seem at odds to how they’ve been acting (such as a trusted member of a team sabotaging a crucial resource) or the action is vague with no discernible purpose (such as a Character meeting with an unknown person in secret).",
					"HEADQUARTERS": "A setting in this Turning Point is a Character’s main headquarters. For instance, it may be the ritzy bar where the mob boss runs his empire, or the wizard’s wilderness tower.",

					"SECRET INFORMATION LEAKED": "Information that should not have gotten into the wrong hands has.

Whatever the trouble is, it should be something that can be solved and will likely constitute a problem for a Character.",
					"SOLE SURVIVOR": "This Turning Point involves some kind of process of elimination where there is only one left. This can be a battle, but doesn’t have to be.

					"TOKEN RESPONSE": "A Character or organization acting in this Turning Point does the bare minimum to address a problem, or makes just a token effort, as opposed to doing something truly effective. For instance, a notorious space pirate has been captured, but instead of receiving serious prison time, the federation government goes very lenient on him and releases him from prison in a week.",

					"A PROBLEM RETURNS": "A problem that had been thought resolved returns in some fashion. This can be a problem from this Adventure, from a previous Adventure, or something inferred from the past.

Or, it could be unexpected, like a Character suddenly shooting a captured villain right before he was about to reveal crucial details.",
					"NOT THEIR MASTER": "A Character in this Turning Point who is assumed to be working for one source turns out to be working for another.

This secret gives Characters an option to stop an otherwise overwhelming or powerful problem.",
					"HIDDEN AGENDA": "A Character either reveals, or is found out to have, a motive that they had not previously exposed. For instance, maybe the detective isn’t investigating the murder out of dedication to his job, but the victim used to be a love interest of his.

Whichever the case, the agenda now becomes known to others.",

					"QUIET CATASTROPHE": "Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen. This is similar to the Action Plot Point Catastrophe, except that it is accompanied by less action.

Or, the investigator discovers the ancient vampire he had destroyed is, somehow, back.",
					"AN OBJECT OF UNKNOWN USE IS FOUND": "A Character finds something that they think is useful, but they do not know in what way.

This connection can be anything from showing a personal interest in the Character to asking them to become a business partner, etc. Whatever the connection is, it will have a lasting impact beyond this Turning Point.",

					"INNOCENCE": "This Turning Point involves an element of innocence, usually an innocent person in an otherwise less than innocent situation. For instance, an average citizen finds herself in the middle of two vampires battling. This can also be considered a “fish out of water” Plot Point, where someone who does not belong in a situation finds themselves in that situation.",
					"CLEAR THE RECORD": "A Character is given the task of clearing someone or something of a false claim. For instance, a friend says they are wrongly convicted of a crime and that the evidence is out there to prove it. The task may come to the Character officially, given by another Character, or it may be something that falls into their lap, such as discovering the truth themselves and only they know it. For instance, a foreign power has staged a catastrophe to start a war, but a handful of Characters know the truth ... if only they can reach headquarters in time to tell them before warships are launched.",
					"WILLING TO TALK": "A Character is in a mood to talk. Whatever it is they have to say, it’s important to furthering the Plotline.",

This friend can be an already existing Character in the Adventure or someone not on the Characters List. Whoever the friend is attached to, that is the Character Invoked, not the friend.",
					"UNTOUCHABLE": "A Character is, in some manner, untouchable by others in this Turning Point. For instance, a villain who is a world leader and thus can’t be directly attacked without triggering an international incident, or a superhero who is nearly impervious to harm. The untouchableness should serve a plot purpose, so that Characters are forced to take other actions to advance the Plotline.",

					"A MEETING OF MINDS": "This Turning Point involves two Characters coming together for a discussion of importance.",
					"TIME LIMIT": "A task must be accomplished within a certain amount of time or a Character will suffer consequences. The time limit does not need to expire within this Turning Point and could extend beyond it further into the Adventure, but it should terminate within this Adventure to give the Characters a reason to accomplish the task. Failure to accomplish the task should be significant. For instance, if a cure to a toxin isn’t found within a day, the prince will die.",
					"THE HIDDEN HAND": "Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it is clear that it was caused on purpose by someone of unknown identity.

The act of finding the thing could take place in this Turning Point, or a Character learns of the need to find something.

					"USED AGAINST THEM": "A resource owned or aligned with one Character is somehow turned against them in this Turning Point. For instance, a small starship is being pursued by three massive battle cruisers.

Or, a wizard may command a powerful golem, but another wizard casts a spell to make the golem attack its master.",

For instance, occult investigators researching a mysterious death discover that the deceased person sold his soul to a demon ten years ago, and they suspect the death is the demon having come to collect.",
					"A NEW ENEMY": "This Turning Point presents a new threat to a Character. It is a threat that may or may not be directly related to any Plotlines but must be dealt with all the same. For instance, explorers deep under the earth are moving through an ancient ruin to find their lost comrade when they are beset upon by dinosaurs who nest in the area. This results automatically in a New Character.",
					"ALLIANCE": "One group offers to ally with another. This may be a surprise alliance, such as an enemy wanting to join with another enemy to take on a common foe, or it could be something less dramatic, such as the FBI offering to assist local law enforcement in solving a crime.

For instance, the prince claiming he is the rightful ruler of a kingdom is actually a shapeshifting doppelgänger assuming the role.",
					"IT’S BUSINESS": "This Turning Point involves business or commerce in some way. It can either be a business transaction, or a business is involved in the Turning Point.

If this would remove a Player Character completely from the List, or if when rolling for the Character you get a result of “New Character”, then treat this as a result of “Choose The Most Logical Character”. If there is no possible Character to choose without removing a Player Character completely from the List, then roll again on the Meta Plot Points Table. This change can be reflected in the activity in this Turning Point or not.",
						"CHARACTER UPGRADE": "A Character becomes more important, gaining 2 slots on the Characters List even if it pushes them past 3 slots. When you roll on the Characters List to see who the Character is, treat a result of “New Character” as “Choose The Most Logical Character”. This change can be reflected in the activity in this Turning Point or not.",
						"PLOTLINE COMBO": "This Turning Point is about more than one Plotline at the same time. Roll again on the Plotlines List and add that Plotline to this Turning Point along with the original Plotline rolled. If when rolling for an additional Plotline you roll the same Plotline already in use for this Turning Point, then treat the result as a “Choose The Most Logical Plotline”. If there are no other Plotlines to choose from, then create a new Plotline as the additional Plotline. If a Conclusion is rolled as a Plot Point during this Turning Point, apply it to the Plotline that seems most appropriate. If another Conclusion is rolled, continue to apply them to the additional Plotlines in this Turning Point if you can. It is possible with repeated results of “Plotline Combo” to have more than two Plotlines combined in this way.",

					<p>Search terms are <a target="_blank" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression'>regular expressions</a>.<p>
					<p>What this means is that you can search for multiple items at once by separating the terms with a |. For example: <code>alice|rabbit</code> returns prompts containing either "alice" or "rabbit".<br></p>
					<p>The downside to this is that you have to escape periods, plus signs, dollar signs, and question marks with a backslash. For example:</p>
					<ul><li><i>Who?</i> becomes <code>Who\?</code></li><li><i>$20.00</i> becomes <code>\$20\.00</code><li><i>Bill+Ted</i> becomes <code>Bill\+Ted</code></li></ul>
					<p>Search terms are also case insensitive, and leading and trailing spaces are stripped.</p>

			<div id="alice">
				Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice
				she had peeped into the book her sister was
				reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures
				or conversations?”
				So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
				whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
				suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
				There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say
				to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
				to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of
				its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
				that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
				curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
				under the hedge.
				In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
				The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had
				not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
				Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her
				and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
				was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards
				and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves
				as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to
				drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
				it.
				“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave
				they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which
				was very likely true.)
				Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said
				aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I
				think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
				was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
				practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got
				to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
				Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the
				people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening,
				this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you
				know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as
				you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for
				asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
				Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night,
				I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you
				were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a
				mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
				herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see,
				as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off,
				and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah,
				tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry
				leaves, and the fall was over.
				Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead;
				before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment
				to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and
				whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be
				seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
				There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up
				the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
				Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny
				golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
				locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
				time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches
				high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
				Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and
				looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
				about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
				doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my
				shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see,
				so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
				impossible.
				There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
				another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
				bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label,
				with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.
				It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look
				first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about
				children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember
				the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and
				that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
				much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
				However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact,
				a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very
				soon finished it off.
