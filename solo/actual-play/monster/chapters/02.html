		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Angry d6</em>. Remove <em>Caked d8</em> complication. She got cleaned up.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Remove <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication. Her nap sobered her up.<br>
		  <strong>Cami:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Insecure d8</em>. Remove <em>Ashamed d6</em> complication. She escaped to her room to center herself.</p>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d8, Insecurity d8) [3, 8, 3] = 11 (d8)<br>
		  <strong>Jess:</strong> While we're gone, she attempts to soothe Cami's insecurity. (Yandere d8, Cami d10, Presence d6, Treat d8) [5, 1, 1, 2] =  7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		   <strong>Cami:</strong> Step up stress to <em>Insecure d12</em> from 2 hitches and gain a PP (2). Jess tries to convince Cami that she should stop worrying about me because I'm a human and I don't matter, but highlighting the differences between us only makes Cami even more upset.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Seoyun, Finola, and I head into town to hit the local grocery store. [1] Altered Scene. [Actions: Conceal Balance] Someone or something is off-balance?<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have difficulty hiding her tails? (50/50) [67] No.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is Finola still drunk? (50/50) [14] Yes. I thought it'd be out of her system after her nap, but nope.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Take <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication.</p>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Halloween is soon. Is it today? (50/50) [23] Yes. It's Halloween night right now.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Are the streets crowded? (Likely) [69] No. Surprisingly, the streets are not full of trick-or-treaters at the moment.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>After helping Finola get cleaned up, I ventured to Seoyun's room on the second floor, with the little faerie cradled in my hands since she had still not sobered. I knocked on the door and it opened a moment later.</p>
		<p>Seoyun stood in the doorway, one arm braced against the frame like she were posing for a photo shoot. She greeted me with a vulpine smile and glittering amber eyes.</p>
		<p>"Seth."</p>
		<p>The sheer weight of the sensuality dripping from her voice resonated within me, and I instinctually felt the need to either throw myself at her or run for the hills. Instead, I held Finola closer to me and straightened my back.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Seoyun. I need to head into town to pick up some snack supplies for our celebration, and I thought that if you wanted to stretch your legs some, I could really use your help," I suggested.</p>
		<p>Seoyun tilted her head forward, her eyes never leaving mine, and her long wavy auburn hair flowed around her face to frame her features perfectly, like she had practiced the maneuver hundreds of times, which she may have.</p>
		<p>"A road trip. Just you and I?" she practically purred, her fox ears twitching in excitement.</p>
		<p>I cleared my throat, then nodded toward Finola. "And this little troublemaker."</p>
		<p>Seoyun's eyes narrowed and she pulled back, crinkling her nose as though I were holding a bundle of sweaty gym socks rather than an adorable but intoxicated little girl. "Bah. Finola? I'll have to think about it."</p>
		<p>"Please?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun have a condition for agreeing to help me? (50/50) [47] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Actions: Ambush Exterior] She wants to hunt.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Her eyes flicked back and forth between the faerie and me as she debated. Finally, she huffed and said, "Fine, but I have a condition."</p>
		<p>"What is it?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun flipped her hair over her shoulder in a motion reminiscent of Cami. "If you're getting snacks, I want a snack, too. It's been far too long since I've hunted."</p>
		<p>I frowned while I considered the implications. Seoyun was a kumiho, also known as a nine-tailed fox spirit, and as such, she needed to feed off the spirit energy of humans to sustain herself. Obviously I didn't want anyone hurt, but I also couldn't deny a guest sustinence, and furthermore, anything that happened outside the grounds of the boardinghouse was technically no longer our responsibility.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." I sighed, dropping my shoulders a fraction. "Yeah, okay. Just be careful."</p>
		<p>Seoyun darted forward and planted a kiss on my cheek before I could respond.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, sweetie," she crooned, then quickly disappeared down the hallway toward the stairs, two large and fluffy fox tails trailing behind her.</p>
		<p>From my hands, I heard Finola singing, "Seoyun and Seth, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G."</p>
		<p>I hung my head and groaned, causing the little girl to break down into a fit of giggles.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything happen on the way into town? (Unlikely) [3] Exceptional yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What happens? [Actions: Free Elements] It begins downpouring.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Moments later, the kumiho and I got into my sporty hatchback and headed into town with Finola resting in the back seat.</p>
		<p>The dirt road leading into the town of Forest Glen was long and winding, framed by thick barriers of trees on both sides. The surrounding forest went on as far as the eye could see, rising along the hills that encircled the town, and gave the distinct feeling that the town and the boardinghouse were cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
		<p>Night was fully upon us and the rain was falling in sheets. The downpour blocked out the moonlight and turned the dirt road into muddy slop. It was probably insane for me to drive in these conditions, but I was determined to make this anniversary celebration a success, and for that we needed party supplies.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d6, Downpour d10) [2, 1,5] = 7 (d4)<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> I try driving safely through the night rain. (Housemaster d8, Seoyun d8, Awareness d6, Drive d6) [1, 1, 4, 3] = 7 (d4). Failure.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Bargain Tactic] My mistake gives Seoyun something to hold over my head later.<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> Take <em>Insecure d4</em> stress. Take <em>Guilt Material d8</em> complication from 2 hitches and gain a PP (2). I'm frustrated at my inability to keep my guest safe, but Seoyun finds it hilarious and will probably use it against me.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is Seoyun discussing? [Character Conversations: Praise / Quiet] She's going off about how brave I am. Who knows if she's being serious or not.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"I can barely see anything in this, even with my night vision. You are <em>so</em> brave to be driving in this storm, Seth," Seoyun said in admiration as she peered through the windshield, though I doubted her sincerity.</p>
		<p>I kept my eyes focused on what little I could see of the road. "It's just a bit further. We'll be fine."</p>
		<p>Seoyun laughed merrily. "Oh, I have no doubt."</p>
		<p>She grasped my knee to punctuate her statement, startling me. The timing couldn't have been worse, and I oversteered as I entered the next turn. The backend of the car kicked out and we began to drift around the bend, nearly going sideways. Seoyun laughed in delight, and her hand squeezed my knee as I worked the accelerator and clutch, steering into the slide to right the vehicle. My heart was pounding in my chest and my knuckles were white from my death grip on the steering wheel, but we were now facing the proper direction as we zoomed down the treacherous road through the blinding rain.</p>
		<p>"Dammit," I grumbled under my breath.</p>
		<p>I could sense Seoyun grinning at me out of the corner of my eye. "You almost killed us!" She sounded thrilled.</p>
		<p>We both knew that I was the only one of the three in the car that was at risk of going out in an embarrassing vehicular death, but I didn't feel the need to correct her or fuel her teasing.</p>
		<p>When I didn't respond, the kumiho chuckled softly and ruffled my hair. "You're no fun. Just relax and enjoy the drive." She withdrew her hand and gazed out her window. "The rain is really soothing."</p>
		<p>Seoyun wasn't wrong, and while the driving conditions never improved, eventually the quiet in the car and the sounds of the rain beating on the roof lulled me into a state of calm. The remainder of our trip into town was blessedly uneventful. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Increase CF to 6.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Seoyun, Finola, and I go shopping. [4] Interrupt Scene. [Event Focus: NPC Action][Actions: Expose Benefits] Seoyun takes her chance at hunting before we go shopping.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>We arrived in town and parked in the small lot beside the Village Market, our local mom-and-pop grocery store. I roused the sleeping faerie and convinced her to hide away in the hood of my light jacket, then Seoyun and I exited the car and dashed through the rain for cover under the awning hanging above the store entrance. Once out of the rain and I had ensured that Finola was still nestled safely and out of sight, I glanced at my kumiho companion. </p>
		<p>Seoyun had absorbed her fox ears and tails, and now appeared indisguishable from your average human, other than looking like a supermodel who was apparently slumming it in a backwater town. Her red dress was soaked through and molded to her body in ways that encouraged me to keep my eyes focused above her neckline. Her auburn hair was drenched and clung to her cheeks and forehead, but as typical of her, the wet bangs somehow only managed to make her look even more seductive. Seoyun was looking at me expectantly.</p>
		<p>I furrowed my brow. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I'm hungry," she replied calmly, but with the eyes of a predator.</p>
		<p>I sighed in exasperation. "You want to do this now?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun merely smiled in response, the light from the shop entrance glinting off her canines.</p>
		<p>"Oooh. This'll be fun," Finola chirped from my jacket hood.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is there an obvious victim in the vicinity? (50/50) Otherwise she'll have to track. [66] No. She'll have to rely on her supernatural senses.</p>
		  <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> (2d6, Rain d6) [6, 2, 2] = 8 (d6)<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> She tries to locate someone with scent. (Kumiho d8, Seth d10, Awareness d6, Canine Senses d6, Notice d8) [2, 1, 2, 6, 1] = 10 (d4). Spent a PP (0) to keep an extra effort die. Success.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Betray Protection] Her actions and appearance make it difficult for her to blend in.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> Take <em>Remarkable d8</em> complication from 2 hitches and gain a PP (1).</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Where is the victim located? [Locations: Welcoming / Horrible] They're in a haunted house.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Without saying another word, Seoyun walked past me and entered the rain. I grumbled to myself and followed her.</p>
		<p>The kumiho lead me around to the back of the grocery store, which happened to be marked by a series of signs indicating a haunted house. It was Halloween, after all, though I had forgotten that the owners of the Village Market liked to host their own little spooky event every year. There was quite a crowd when I had caught the event last year, but the downpour had seemingly taken its toll on the turnout for tonight's event.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Are there are any other visitors here? (Very Unlikely) [88] Exceptional no. Not only is the place empty, the employee isn't even manning their station.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun and I reached the store's back room. The large overhead bay door was raised, revealing a maze of black sheets hanging from the ceiling, filling the space of the loading dock and recycling center that I was familiar with. A cheap skeleton had been propped beside the bay door, with its arm extended and a boney finger pointing toward what I assumed was the entrance to the maze.</p>
		<p>Seoyun deduced the same, and she flashed me a grin before disappearing into the maze. Finola cackled over my shoulder and urged me on excitedly. I shushed her, then entered the maze as well.</p>
		<p>I quickly caught up with Seoyun, as the "maze" was in fact a twisting but linear path. She stood, waiting for me, before a small table decorated with fake skulls and a large water-filled bowl in which skinned grapes designed to look like eyeballs floated along its surface. The sheeted corridor hedging us in was narrow and dark in either direction, with illumination provided solely by fake candles and an overhead strobe light. A looping audio track of spooky noises droned on from the store's PA system at a volume a bit louder than was necessary. The combined assault to my senses gave the impression that nothing existed beyond this small space inhabited by me and Seoyun. …and Finola.</p>
		<p>Seoyun held her hand out to me, and I hesitated for a moment, then shrugged and placed my hand in hers. She grinned so widely that I thought that her face was going to split in two. Finola snickered to herself behind my ear.</p>
		<p>The kumiho happily tugged me down the sheet maze until we reached the epicenter. As we exited the maze, we entered a wide open space containing a long table loaded with bowls of candy and various Halloween-themed nicknacks, some presumably handmade by the shop owners.</p>
		<p>There wasn't anyone here but the three of us.</p>
		<p>I gave Seoyun a questioning look. She rolled her eyes, then tapped her nose, and pointed toward a door beneath a glowing exit sign.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun bring me with her? (50/50)[54] Yes. Apparently she wants to share this with me.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the victim like? [Characters: Intense / Lonely] They don't have a lot of friends.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> How do they look? [Character Appearance: Young / Familiar] They are the child of the shop owners. We know each other since this is a small town and I come here often.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> How do they act? [Character Personality: Adventurous / Confident] They're surprisingly outgoing despite not having a lot of friends.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> Any interesting skills? [Character Skills: Perception / Develop] They are very observant.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is the character a girl? (50/50) [41] Yes. Her name is Melody.</p>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Because she's lonely, confident, young, and familiar, I'm wondering if she has a crush on me. Does she? (Likely) [85] No.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> How about on Seoyun? (Likely) [22][Event Focus: PC Negative][Actions: Inspect Business] Yes. She has a crush on Seoyun and she is very suspicious of me.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is she suspicious of men in general? (Unlikely) [100] Exceptional no. Haha. Nope. She just hates me.</p>
		  <p><strong>Melody:</strong> Create as minor GMC with <em>Sheltered Girl d6</em>, <em>Observant d8</em>, <em>Temerarious d6</em>, and <em>Crush d4</em> traits.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is Melody doing? [Actions: Imprison Bureaucracy] She's hiding out because her parents made her run this display.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What kind of costume is she wearing? [Creature Descriptors: Metallic / Solitary] She's dressed as the bride of Frankenstein.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun quietly opened the exit door and slipped through. I caught the door before it closed and followed her out.</p>
		<p>A sheet of water flowing from the roof like a waterfall walled us in to a narrow space between it and the wooden siding of the shop's exterior. Seoyun stood just to my left, having already spotted her target.</p>
		<p>Melody, the child of the shop owners, squatted with her back turned only a few paces in front of Seoyun. Her usual curly chestnut-brown hair was hidden beneath a gawdy wig of black hair with a white streak on either side, styled in a tall beehive that exposed the pale skin of her delicate neck. I could see over Melody's shoulder that she was watching videos on her phone, apparently so engrossed that she hadn't even noticed us.</p>
		<p>When Seoyun turned to me, I furrowed my brow and mouthed "Melody?" She put her hands on her hips and tilted her head in reproach.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Seth:</strong> Begin contest. I attempt to dissuade her from sucking the life energy of someone that we know so well. (Protective d8, Seoyun d8, Presence d8, Insecure d4) [8, 6, 6, 6, 2] = 14 (d8). Gained a PP (3) for including d4 stress. Remove <em>Insecure d4</em> stress.</p>
		  <p><strong>Seoyun:</strong> This is the reason that she agreed to come along, so of course she's going to guilt me into it. (Sly as a Fox d8, Seth d10, Presence d10, Influence d8, Guilt Material d8) [4, 8, 6, 3, 1] = 18 (d10). Spent a PP (0) to keep an extra effort die. Success.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Refuse Personal] I'm not happy with her decisions and it's put me on guard.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> Take <em>Untrustworthy d6</em> complication from hitch and gain a PP (1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I got the message and acquiesced to her wishes.</p>
		<p>When Seoyun saw that I was not arguing further, she smiled seductively before turning away from me, then took a few steps forward and silently squatted behind her teenage victim. I hung back, though I intended to keep a watchful eye. I wouldn't allow her "snack" to come at the price of Melody's life.</p>
		<p>"What're you watching?" Seoyun asked in a near whisper from just over Melody's shoulder.</p>
		<p>Melody jumped in shock and nearly threw her phone as she flailed her arms to prevent herself from falling over. Seoyun barely managed to suppress a laugh.</p>
		<p>The young girl attempted to regain her composure as she struggled to her feet. Seoyun watched her in silence with her arms crossed and her head canted, and though I couldn't see it, I imagine that she also wore an amused expression.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is Melody pleased to see Seoyun? (Likely) Otherwise she's embarrassed. [82] No. She she isn't thrilled to have Seoyun see her this way.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Melody spun to face us, focusing almost entirely on Seoyun.</p>
		<p>"I-it's you!" she blurted. "What? Why?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun smiled and took a step closer. She extended an arm and brushed the back of her fingers against the girl's white-painted cheek. "Hey, Melody. I like your costume," she said softly in a voice sweet like honey.</p>
		<p>Melody struggled to form words before sputtering, "N-no… It's dumb. It's just all I had."</p>
		<p>She stood stiff as a board as Seoyun took another step closer and reached up to appraise Melody's wig, bringing the two so close that their chests nearly touched. Seoyun trailed her fingers down the fake hair and along Melody's neck, until they reached her shoulders. She gazed into the girl's eyes and whispered just above the noise of the rain, "You look cute. I could just eat you up."</p>
		<p>Melody swallowed, never breaking eye contact, and nervously wet her lips.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Melody attempt to resist? (Nearly Impossible) [25] Yes. Even she thinks Seoyun is being too aggressive.</p>
		  <p><strong>Seoyun:</strong> Begin contest. She tries tricking Melody into letting her feed. (Sly as a Fox 2d8, Melody d4, Presence d10, Influence d8) [1, 8, 1, 5, 7] = 15 (d10). Spent a PP (0) to activate <em>Yeah, I Really Do</em> SFX to double distinction die and keep an extra effort die.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the complication? [Actions: Harm Cooperation] Seoyun's actions are making me trust her less and less.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong> Step up complication to <em>Untrustworthy d10</em> from 2 hitches and gain a PP (1).</p>
		  <p><strong>Melody:</strong> She attempts to resist Seoyun's seduction. (Sheltered Girl d6, Observant d8, Temerarious d6, Crush d4) [5, 5, 5, 4] = 10 (d8). Failure. Take <em>Exhausted d12</em> stress. She's taken out.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As I uncomfortably observed the two girls from only a few paces away, I could feel Finola clinging to my shoulder blade. The little faerie had escaped her hiding place and was peeking her head over my shoulder to watch the scene unfold.</p>
		<p>Melody took a step back, but Seoyun followed. The young girl found her back pressed against the wall, and the kumiho leaned into her, resting her elbows on either side of Melody's head, trapping her and bringing their faces close. The girl's eyes keep flicking to Seoyun's lips as her breath rate increased.</p>
		<p>Seoyun tilted her head toward her, and Melody closed her eyes and stilled her body, either in submission or an attempt to play dead. Seoyun brought her lips to Melody's. After a few seconds into the kiss, Seoyun parted her lips and the girl melted into her, forcing Seoyun to grasp Melody's shoulders to keep her standing.</p>
		<p>As the kiss proceeded, Melody's body grew more and more slack, until I wasn't sure that the girl was even conscious any longer. Seoyun was seemingly unaffected as she continued to press her lips to the limp girl's. It was when Melody's eyes opened, and I could see that her eyes had rolled to the back of her head, that I decided to step in.</p>
		<p>I put a hand on Seoyun's shoulder. "Hey. That's enough."</p>
		<p>Seoyun ignored me. She hungrily mashed her lips against the girl's, bending at the waist to follow her down as Melody collapsed to her knees. Seoyun wrapped her arms around Melody's boneless body, crushing the girl against her as she devoured her mouth. Melody's arms dangled loosely by her side.</p>
		<p>I gripped Seoyun by the hair and yanked back, forcefully separating her mouth from Melody's. Her eyes met my own and she growled savagely, baring her teeth.</p>
		<p>"Seoyun. <em>Stop</em>," I ordered, as if commanding a dog.</p>
		<p>Seoyun glared angrily up at me, rapidly breathing in and out through her nose, still growling softly as she clutched Melody to her.</p>
		<p>"<em>Seoyun</em>," I called firmly again.</p>
		<p>She closed her eyes to collect herself, though her brows remained knitted in anger or frustration. After a few moments, her breathing slowed and her face relaxed. She gently lowered Melody to the ground.</p>
		<p>"Are you good?" I questioned.</p>
		<p>Seoyun knelt by the unconscious girl and ran her fingers through her own hair. "Yeah. I'm okay," she replied softly, avoiding my gaze.</p>
		<p>"How about her?" I asked.</p>
		<p>"She'll be fine." Seoyun inserted her thumb and forefinger into Melody's mouth and fished around, before retrieving a small pearlescent marble. The kumiho popped it into her mouth like a piece of candy and swallowed. I knew the marble to be her <em>yeowoo guseul</em>, a fox marble, her means of extracting spirit energy from her victims. "She'll wake back up soon and not even remember that I was here."</p>
		<p>"You mean 'we were'?" I clarified.</p>
		<p>"No," she replied without further elaboration.</p>
		<p>"That was awesome!" Finola shouted as she jumped onto my shoulder, interrupting before I could continue my line of questioning. "Melody was like 'omigawd ur so hawt' and Seoyun was like 'dam rite. i'm gonna make u my woman' and then she rocked Melody's world but Seth got jelly and was like 'no way, ur <em>my</em> bitch'! So cool!" the faerie excitedly recounted her version of the events.</p>
		<p>I grimaced. "I don't think that's how it went."</p>
		<p>Seoyun, now standing, crossed her arms and rolled her eyes at Finola. "I didn't 'rock her world.' I'm not a succubus. I ate her soul."</p>
		<p>"Death by smooches!" Finola shouted with glee.</p>
		<p>"Just…shut up," Seoyun growled.</p>
		<p>I shushed the abnoxious faerie before she could irritate Seoyun further and coaxed her back into the hiding spot in my hood. With Seoyun sated, it was time to move on before the Melody returned to consciousness, though I was unsure as to how much she'd remember. It would probably be best if we made our shopping trip at her parents' store a short one.</p>
