<ul>
<li>Illyana Rasputin</li>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> A Class. Teleporting and magic.</li>
<li><strong>Hero:</strong> Vengeful wielder of the Soulsword.</li>
<li><strong>Trouble:</strong> Sorceress Supreme of Limbo.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb (+5):</strong> Fight</li>
<li><strong>Great (+4):</strong> Athleticism, Willpower</li>
<li><strong>Good (+3):</strong> Physique, Presence, Provoke</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Attribute Bonuses:</strong> Athleticism +1, Physique +1/+2
(WR2/AR1 or WR4/AR2 with armor), Presence +1, Willpower +1/+3 (WR2/AR1
or WR8/AR4 with magic)</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Magic:</em> Illyana learned a combination of light and dark
magic while in Limbo and furthered her studies with Doctor Strange. She
is considered an A Class magic user. When using magic, her attribute and
bonuses reflect a +4 increase to Willpower. (8)</li>
<li><em><a href="./images/magik/illyana%20(16).jpg">Stepping
Disc</a>:</em> Illyana can create a circular disc anywhere and at any
angle (it does not require a surface). Stepping through the disc
teleports her anywhere in space and time, and she can do this multiple
times in a row, but she must always travel to Limbo before her final
destination.</li>
<li><em>Limbo Blast:</em> Illyana can fire large blasts of energy from
Limbo using the stepping disc portals, which function as a floating
energy cannon with WR 2 for the cost of a Fate Point. For 2 Fate Points,
she can hit multiple targets at once without dividing her
Successes.</li>
<li><em>Mystical Eldritch Armor:</em> Illyana's armor grants her super
strength. She can only use the armor while she has possession of her
Soulsword. For 1 Fate Point she can conjure the armor and gain +2
Physique while it's active. The armor lasts until the Scene ends, it's
dispelled, or Illyana falls unconscious.</li>
<li><em>Soulsword:</em> Illyana's sword is formed from a piece of her
soul. It is not physically real, and therefore can only harm magical
creatures. It does WR 2, adds +1 to Fight, and benefits from Illyana's
magic though; it does not benefit from Physique. Because the sword is a
piece of her soul, anyone in possession of the Soulsword has basic
access to Illyana's abilities--namely magic and creating stepping
discs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permissions/Denials</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Portals:</em> Illyana's stepping disc portal can remain open as
long as she wants and has been seen to grow large enough to swallow the
X-Mansion. The portal opens quickly enough that she can use it as a
means of dodging and countering in combat. While Illyana has been known
to travel as far as the other side of the globe, traveling so far puts a
strain on her ability and she runs the risk of arriving in the wrong
place or even the wrong time.</li>
<li><em>Demon Queen:</em> Illyana is the ruler of Limbo and can summon
demons via her stepping disc to fight by her side.</li>
<li><em><a href="./images/magik/illyana%20(15).jpg">Darkchylde</a>:</em>
When Illyana is overcome with emotions such as anger, she "hulks out"
and becomes Darkchylde, which is the form of the demon queen of Limbo.
She has difficulty maintaining control over her mind and emotions in
this form and basically becomes another personality. While in this form,
she denies any attempts of telepathic probing used against her. Illyana
will revert to normal when rendered unconscious.</li>

<li><em>Superhuman Physique +4:</em> Rogue is an A Class bruiser.
(8)</li>
<li><em>Power Absorbsion:</em> For the cost of 1 Fate Point, Rogue can
borrow a mutant's powers for the scene. Power absorbsion only requires
close proximity.</li>
<li><em>Energy Drain:</em> Touching skin causes a fixed amount of 4
Physical Stress for every turn that she is touching. This Stunt triggers
Power Absorbion for free and also shuts down that mutant's powers
temporarily, whether intended or not.</li>
<li><em>Missile Mode:</em> Rogue may use Physique in place of
Athleticism or Fight when propelling herself through the air with the
intent to smash into or through the target.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permissions/Denials</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Flight:</em> Rogue is able to fly by willing herself to. She
does not use an external force like telekinesis.</li>
<li><em>Touch:</em> Rogue mostly has control over her energy drain power
activating by touch these days, but it can accidentally be triggered
when she's scared.</li>

nor have them performed on her, including standard telepathy. She also
has super strength, has limitless stamina, doesn't require oxygen, and
doesn't feel emotion.</li>
<li><em>Resources:</em> Emma and her connections has been one of the
best things to happen to the X-Men, especially with Xavier's wishy-washy
standings with the government and society as of late. She basically
finances the X-Men at this point.</li>

<li><em>Past:</em> Jean was dragged from the past into the present by
Beast. Unlike the rest of the team, she has managed to adapt quite
quickly--which is good because her future is apparently a nightmare of
misery and death, with the silver lining being that she's one of the
most powerful people in the galaxy.</li>
<li><em>Growing Powers:</em> Jean is much more powerful than she
originally was in her timeline. It's uncertain whether these changes
came from being taught by teachers more experienced than Xavier was back
then, or if it has been brought about by the increased level of combat
that present day X-Men face. Either way, her powers are quickly
manifesting and it's become a concern for X-Men both from the past and
present day.</li>
