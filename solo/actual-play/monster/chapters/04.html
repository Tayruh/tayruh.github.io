		<h1 id="chapter%204">Chapter 4</h1>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Cami:</strong>  Step down stress to <em>Insecure d6</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Seoyun:</strong>  Remove <em>Untrustworthy d6</em> complication. She was a good girl while unsupervised.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> I drop off the goods with Erin. [4] Interrupt Scene. [Event Focus: NPC Positive][Characters List: Melody][Actions: Support Interior] Hmm. Not sure.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Did Melody hide in my car? (Very Unlikely) Otherwise the girls suggest inviting her. [93] Exceptional no. She's still back in town and feeling ill. The girls make an argument for inviting her to the boardinghouse in the near future.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I brought my car to a stop in the large circular driveway in front of our boardinghouse. The only other vehicle parked there was our SUV, which we typically reserved for hauling around big things, like machinery, or Sera.</p>
		<p>The large and intimidating Victorian mansion loomed over us. The boardinghouse had two floors, with a partial third rising from its center, making the building far wider than it was tall. The dark gray shingles covering its roof were visible in the overcast night only by the wet surface reflecting light. The pointed arches of the roof were sharp and aggressive, and a gargoyle statue glaring down at us decorated each of its highest peaks. Or at least, I believed that they were statues. I'd never seen them move, anyway.</p>
		<p>Seoyun and I got out of the car and stretched, shaking off the long drive. I glanced over at the kumiho, and she had already let her fox ears and two large tails rematerialize. She had once told me that a significant portion of a kumiho's power is held in their tails, and keeping them absorbed while trying to pass as human expended a lot of energy. However, having all nine fluffy tails present while indoors tended to be a hazard, as I had witnessed myself, so she aimed for balance.</p>
		<p>As for the ears, Seoyun had told me, with a sly smile and a wink, that "guys love 'em," whatever that was supposed to mean.</p>
		<p>I popped the rear hatch of the car and grabbed two bags of supplies, then stepped back to make room for Seoyun to do the same. She only managed one bag, not being blessed with supernatural strength, nor much in the way of muscles. Not in this particular human form, at least.</p>
		<p>Finola seated herself atop my head and held strands of my hair in her tiny hands like they were horse reins. Now that we were home, the little faerie was free to scamper off to wherever she liked, but clinging to me like this was the norm for her and I didn't mind it.</p>
		<p>I felt a tug on my hair and the heel of her teeny foot bop me on the head. "Hyaa! Giddy up, lil horsey!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is it Seoyun who suggests that Melody join us? (50/50) Otherwise it's Finola. [81] No. Finola suggests it.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I followed the little one's instructions and proceeded toward the mansion. Seoyun walked after me, then increased her pace and came to my side. I turned my head to look at her and she gave me a brilliant smile. All signs of moping were gone and she seemed to be back in her usual spirits, for better or worse.</p>
		<p>I think one of us was going to say something, but before we could, Finola randomly blurted, "We should have invited Melody."</p>
		<p>Seoyun let out a sharp, surprised laugh. </p>
		<p>I just grimaced. "Are you crazy, Finola?" Seoyun smirked at me, like the answer was obvious. I rolled my eyes and tried again. "Why would we bring a human here?"</p>
		<p>"She's fun," the faerie replied simply, as if that were the only criteria that mattered. For her, it probably was.</p>
		<p>As we approached the front doors, Seoyun shifted her bag around so that she could open one, since both of my hands were full. The double doors leading inside were tall and wide, and the tiny girl nestled in my hair easily cleared the doorway without me needing to duck my head as I stepped inside.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Do we meet anyone inside? (50/50) [12] Exceptional yes. We meet two people.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> Who? [Descriptions: Dangerously Mundane] Jess.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> Who else? [Descriptions: Majestically Mundane] Cami. That was easy enough to interpret.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What are they doing? [Actions: Leave Weather] They just came indoors themselves. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Cami and Jess stood in the spacious entryway with damp clothes, dripping onto the floor.</p>
		<p>The top of Cami's long, raven hair was slicked back, wet and glistening under the overhead light as though it were sprinkled with diamond dust. Her beautiful black gown clung to her dainty form, flaring wide at the hips, and exposed her porcelain skin, dotted with sparkling droplets of moisture, through the low cut of its bodice. She was a vision.</p>
		<p>In contrast, Jess looked miserable, like a drowned rat. Her short hair was matted to her head and face, except for a small defiant cowlick sticking up in back. Jess kept her eyes glued to the floor, with her shoulders hunched and her arms pressed in tight and straight by her side, and shivered.</p>
		<p>Finola pointed at Jess and laughed so hard that I thought she was going to fall off my head.</p>
		<p>I raised an eyebrow at the vampire and her thrall. "Girls, are you all right?"</p>
		<p>Cami ran a hand across the top of her hair, flattening any would-be loose strands, before she fixed upon me those bright green eyes of hers which glowed against all that pale skin. "We are quite well, housemaster. Thank you."</p>
		<p>I had always found Cami to be intoxicatingly beautiful, and that simple motion and look in her eye made my heart skip a beat. I caught her gaze flick to the pulse in my neck before returning to meet my eyes again, then she gave me a practiced, elegant smile that could have meant anything.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Seoyun get jealous? (50/50) [43] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun didn't seem to appreciate the effect that Cami was having on me, because the kumiho took a step toward the princess, placing herself between two of us, with her back to me. My vision became obscured entirely by two fluffy tails which caressed the sides of my face.</p>
		<p>"What happened to you two?" Seoyun's voice held a trace of mockery. </p>
		<p>Honestly, her tails felt pretty nice against my skin, like giant feather dusters, but it was a bit like breathing into a fuzzy blanket. It was also incredibly embarrassing and I valued being able to see, so I took a step back.</p>
		<p>Her tails followed me. I dodged to the right, and they tracked my movement, smothering my face again. What started as a possessive act became a game for her, and after multiple failed attempts at dodging her, I gave up on being polite, and moved as far away her as I could. I scowled at her, and she just smiled at me like the cat that got the cream.</p>
		<p>Cami's mask was cracking, and she puffed her cheeks in frustration. "If you must know, Jessamine and I went for a delightful stroll in rain."</p>
		<p>Jess huffed, still glowering at the floor. "It was a downpour and she forbid umbrellas."</p>
		<p>"Quite right." Cami gave an elegant nod to her thrall. "Being one with nature in such a manner is simply marvelous."</p>
		<p>A while back, when discussing amenities, I had asked Cami whether it was true that vampires couldn't cross running water. She had laughed, then asked me in return, What constitutes running water? A river, a faucet, a rain drop? It was nearly impossible to take a step on land without crossing groundwater buried somewhere beneath its surface, she had informed me. No, the inability to cross running water was an old wives tale, or going with the theory that myths are borne of belief, not enough people believed in that particular weakness to make it a reality. Whichever the case, Cami was grateful, since she was fond of her showers and baths. And walking in the rain, apparently.</p>
		<p>Jess brushed her wet bangs back in an attempt to stop them from dripping in her face. She shivered again. "My mistress forgets how it feels to be cold."</p>
		<p>The vampire blinked. "I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do." Cami looked at Jess, really looked at her, as if noticing her discomfort for the first time. Her brow crinkled in concern. "Do you suffer, my pet?"</p>
		<p>Jess's face turned crimson and she immediately looked away. "I'll be okay, mistress. Though I would like a change of clothes, soon. Please."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Cami's jealousy outweigh her desire to tend to Jess? (Unikely) Otherwise she leaves with Jess. [21] Yes. She doesn't want to leave Seoyun with me.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Jess stay with Cami? (Very Likely) Otherwise she excuses herself to get changed. [76] Yes. She doesn't want to leave Cami with me.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Do you need to excuse yourself for a change of wardrobe?" Cami asked.</p>
		<p>Jess looked like she desperately wanted to say yes, but then her eyes locked on me, a simple housemaster who was standing here innocently holding groceries and just trying to do his job, and she glared at me like I had nefarious plans for her mistress which I would put into action the moment that Cami and I left her sight. As if Cami couldn't ward off any unwanted advances herself by simply throwing me across the room using just one hand, or by snapping me in two using both. I doubted that Seoyun would stand by as I made a pass at Cami either, not that I planned to.</p>
		<p>Regardless, Jess turned back to Cami and, wearing a forced smile, she said, "I will stay. Thank you."</p>
