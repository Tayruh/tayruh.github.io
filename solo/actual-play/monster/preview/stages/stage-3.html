		<h1 id="chapter%205">Chapter 5</h1>
		<p><small id="note-1"><a href="#1">*1</a></small> Having appeased Gray like he were a freaking bridge troll, he finally granted us passage, allowing us to continue on our way. Finola had chosen to stay behind with the bogeyman, saying that he would be more fun than watching us do work. <small id="note-1a"><a href="#1a">*1a</a></small> I wasn't sure whether that meant he'd be her pranking victim or accomplice, but Seoyun and I left her to it.</p>
		<p>Moments later, the two of us arrived at the door to kitchen at long last. We stepped inside and were greeted with the sight of my dear sister bustling away in an animated fashion. She was in the process of assembling a large snack platter on the island in the middle of the kitchen. Her hair was a mess, like she had just run a marathon. You would think by how frazzled she looked that we were hosting a party for a hundred guests, not just the six tenants that lived with us.</p>
		<p><small id="note-1b"><a href="#1b">*1b</a></small> I tried not to disrupt her workspace as I placed my bags on the far end of the island. Erin looked up, and seeing me standing there, she smiled wide.</p>
		<p>"Great. You're back." She blew an annoying strand of hair out of her face. "Any trouble getting the stuff?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun placed her bag next to mine. "Only that boogerman asshat getting in our faces, like usual."</p>
		<p>"Ugh. I hate that guy." Erin's shoulders drooped and she sighed. "I actually really love this job, except for him."</p>
		<p>Seoyun wrinkled her brow. "He harasses you because you and Seth are the only humans around, and Seth is nearly impossible to scare."</p>
		<p>She actually sounded like she was concerned for Erin. That seemed odd to me. If she really did consider humans to just be food, she wouldn't have had any qualms about Gray feeding off of Erin. I wondered whether the kumiho cared for Erin as more than just a friendly rival and emergency food. And if that were the case, how did she actually feel about Melody?</p>
		<p>Going with that line of thought, I asked Erin, "What do you think about maybe having Melody come visit?"</p>
		<p><small id="note-2"><a href="#2">*2</a></small> My sister stared at me and did a slow blink, like she couldn't comprehend what I had just said.</p>
		<p>"That's .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a horrible idea."</p>
		<p>Seoyun burst out laughing. "Oh, Gray isn't going to like that answer."</p>
		<p>I glared at Seoyun, then turned back to Erin. "Are you sure? Wouldn't it be nice to have a human friend around, though?"</p>
		<p><small id="note-3"><a href="#3">*3</a></small>  There was a loud bang on the counter behind us, making the three of us jump.</p>
		<p>"Are you serious?" Jess snarled. I turned to see her standing by the kitchen door, glaring straight at me. "It's not enough for you to replace me as my mistress's thrall, you need to replace me as Erin's friend too?"</p>
		<p>I was stunned. I'm not sure that it occurred to anyone that Jess would assume we were intending to replace her in anything, least of all as Erin's friend. I had honestly expected the three of them to become a trio of friends. I was beginning to suspect that Jess was incapable of sharing anyone.</p>
		<p><small id="note-4"><a href="#4">*4</a></small> My thoughts were interrupted by Jess leaping at me like a damned cat. Except this cat could rend steel with her claws, and I was far less less durable than that.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><small id="note-5"><a href="#5">*5</a></small> I grab her as she leaps on me, and I use her momentum to flip her behind me. She crashes into the cupboards, shattering plates. <small id="note-6"><a href="#6">*6</a></small> She doesn't waste a second before she rebounds off the ruined cupboard and throws a punch at me.</p>
		<p><strong>Jess:</strong> "Die, you bastard!"<br>
		<strong>Erin:</strong> "Jess, stop!"</p>
		<p><small id="note-7"><a href="#7">*7</a></small> Seoyun grapples Jess from behind before she can land the hit, and I take advantage of their struggle to snag a frying pan off the counter and swing it at Jess's head.</p>
		<p><strong>Erin:</strong> "Seth!"</p>
		<p><small id="note-8"><a href="#8">*8</a></small> Jess is unable to free herself in time and I get a clean hit. The pan smashes into her skull hard enough to put a dent in the pan's surface. Jess would have dropped to her knees, were she not still in Seoyun's hold.</p>
		<p><small id="note-9"><a href="#9">*9</a></small> <strong>Erin:</strong> "Please, just stop! You're being stupid. I can have more than one friend. Being friends with Melody doesn't take away from our friendship."<br>
		<small id="note-10"><a href="#10">*10</a></small> <strong>Jess:</strong> "But I've seen the way my mistress looks at him." <em>She was practically growling.</em> "Camellia is <em>mine</em>. I won't let anyone have her!"<br>
		<strong>Me:</strong> "Jess, I don't even plan on dating Cami. I definitely don't have any desire to be her servant for an eternity. That position is all yours."<br>
		<strong>Seoyun:</strong> "Besides, Seth only has eyes for me. Don't you, sweetie?"</p>
		<p>I don't waste my breathe responding.</p>
		<p><small id="note-11"><a href="#11">*11</a></small> <strong>Jess:</strong> <em>The fight had gone out of her, but she muttered to me,</em> "I don't believe you."<br>
		<strong>Me:</strong> <em>I groaned.</em> "This is why I wanted Erin to have human friends. Your supernatural bond to Cami makes you unstable and dangerous."<br>
		<strong>Jess:</strong> "I <em>am</em> human!" <em>Then in a quieter voice, she said,</em> "I'm not unstable."</p>
		<p><small id="note-12"><a href="#12">*12</a></small> I dismissed Jess's comment. I knew that she was taking Cami's blood to prevent aging, so that she could stay by her side throughout the centuries. The enhanced abilities that it gave her were just a side effect, as was her obsessed devotion to the vampire princess, I suspected. It still felt like splitting hairs to me though.</p>
		<p><strong>Me:</strong> "Just forget it." <em>I sighed.</em> "Erin's right. Bringing Melody here is a bad idea."</p>
		<p>And she was right. Not just because Melody would be in danger, but because I was choosing to put her in danger so that Erin wouldn't be. That kind of action was not me. I was angry at myself for having buckled under the weight of Gray's threat. There had to be another way to protect my sister.</p>
		<p>Seoyun was frowning at me. I think she was as concerned as I was at how Gray would take my change of heart. I guess we would find out soon enough. <small id="note-13"><a href="#13">*13</a></small></p>
