		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Pursue Enemy<br>
		  <strong>Theme:</strong> Villain's Perspective</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The doorbell rang.</p>
		<p>I waited nervously for someone to answer the door. I just had to see him again. My love, my sweet. It had been too long since I'd last seen his face. Nearly a whole twenty-four hours. It felt like I was dying.</p>
		<p>After what seemed like a millennia, the reinforced steel door to Hero HQ opened and Titan, my love, stepped through.</p>
		<p>My man was glorious. Like a chiseled Greek god, or a football player. The corded muscles that ran along his chest and arms looked like they could stop bullets. Which they could, cuz that was his super power. His face, though, was that of a supermodel. Like a manly one, you know? With a strong chin and a stern brow, permanently frozen in a furrow of disapproval. So judgemental and sexy, my sweetums. He was a true hero.</p>
		<p>Titan stood at the threshold with his arms crossed as he scowled at my messenger. Oh, you didn't think that I'd be dumb enough to knock on the door of the largest, most renowned government-funded superhero team in the world, did you? Ha! No way. I might as well have just turned myself in right then. No. I hired a candygram to express the depths of my love.</p>
		<p>The poor underpaid candygram man buckled under the weight of my Titan's judgemental glory while I watched from the safety of a large bush nearby. The man slowly extended his arms to Titan, presenting him with a box of chocolates. I could hear the candies rattle in the container as the man's arm shook. I made a mental note to leave a bad review online.</p>
		<p>Titan stared at the box for a moment, then his shoulders dropped a fraction and he accepted my love. That is, he relieved the candygram man of his box of chocolates with a frown, then snapped "Go!" at the sad soul. My love was nothing if not efficient in his word use.</p>
		<p>The poor man turned on his heel and literally ran away, like he was being chased by a pack of wild coyotes. I began composing my extensive online review in my head.</p>
		<p>Leaving the door wide open, Titan took a step back into the building and placed the box of chocolates atop a tower comprised of my other confessions of love, neatly stacked just beside the door. My heart beat faster. My dearest had kept my gifts in plain sight so that he and everyone on his team had a constant reminder of how much I loved him! The representation of my love for him was marred only slightly by the sign resting against it stating "Monday's trash" that someone seemed to have forgotten there.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What does Titan do now? [Actions: Travel Depletion] He stops me from escaping.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> How? [Character Actions, General: Decrease / Generous] He's reached his tolerance limit.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Titan looked out over the courtyard and shouted, "Hex!"</p>
		<p>I nearly giggled in euphoria. My name in my beloved's mouth sounded like angels singing to my ears. Yes, please. Shout it from the rooftops!</p>
		<p>He took a step forward, then with the deductive reasoning of a grade-schooler, he zeroed in on my hiding spot. I never understood why the heroes' headquarters was furnished with only a single bush on their otherwise vacant, expansive yard.</p>
		<p>Titan towered over my hiding place. "I know you're there, Hex. Come on out." I clamped my hand over my mouth to prevent the giggles. When I didn't move, he muttered, "Hex, I can see your butt." It wasn't a very large bush.</p>
		<p>The jig, as they say, was up. I resigned myself to my fate and rose to my feet. I stood before my love, presenting myself to him in my full glory. In costume, I mean. It's a sweet costume. Tailor-made.</p>
		<p>Titan looked at me with his sexy judgemental stare. I preened for him, though it didn't alter his expression. So guarded of his emotions, this man. But I could fix him.</p>
		<p>"Hex, you need to stop. This is embarrassing," Titan said.</p>
		<p>I batted my eyelashes. Guys like that, right? "C'mon, baby. It's just us here. You don't need to pretend."</p>
		<p>My love sighed and his shoulders drooped. "I'm not pretending. You're a supervillain trespassing on government property. You're lucky that I don't call the whole team on you."</p>
		<p>I frowned a little. That would be incredibly annoying. Though, I was flattered that he thought I rated calling in the whole team. My sweetums acknowledged my power, as any respectful man should. I felt like I was glowing.</p>
		<p>Titan's brow furrowed further. … <em>Furrowed further.</em> Say that ten times fast. … furrowed further furrowed further furrowed further furrowed further furrowed fur—</p>
		<p>"Hex!" my sweetie shouted, snapping me out of my loop.</p>
		<p>"Yes, dear?" I cooed, batting my lashes some more for effect.</p>
		<p>Titan groaned in exasperation. I was pretty sure that I was breaking down his defenses. "What am I supposed to do with you?" he asked.</p>
		<p>I think my brain broke while I pondered the possibilities. I blinked away the images, then squeaked out, "Let's keep this conversation rated PG, okay, sweetie?"</p>
		<p>He was speechless for a moment, then looked away uncomfortably. He appeared to be blushing. Omigawd, omigawd, I have him on the ropes!</p>
		<p>My adorable muscleman cleared his throat and turned his lovingly furrowed gaze on me again. "Seriously, what can I do to make you stop with these… gifts?"</p>
		<p>"<em>I-wanna-go-on-a-date!</em>" I blurted nearly before he finished speaking.</p>
		<p>I felt desperate as I waited with baited breath for his response. My sweetie, however, did not seem surprised by my declaration. He just sighed and looked at me unfurrowed, pitying eyes.</p>
		<p>"A date?"</p>
		<p>I nodded rapidly. "Mhmm!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does he agree? (Unlikely) [75] Nope.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Hex, you're a villain and I'm hero," he began with a frown. "Even though I find you attractive, and even if I were to ignore the criticisms of my teammates and the public, there's still the matter of your list of crimes. Your rap sheet is… long and impressive. It will never work betwe—"</p>
		<p>"<em>INCENDIA!</em>" I snapped, cutting his words short with a towering inferno.</p>
		<p>My love muffin rolled around on the ground as he screamed, desperately trying to douse the magically infused flames. Apparently, bulletproof didn't mean fireproof. Who knew?</p>
		<p>As I calmly walked away from Hero HQ, a warm glow at my back, I pulled my cellphone from my pocket.</p>
		<p>I brought up my chat with my honeybun Vortex, but the last message said, "Stop texting me!" <i>*This user has blocked your account.*</i>"</p>
		<p>It seemed that I would have to make a housecall to my sweet love bunny.</p>
