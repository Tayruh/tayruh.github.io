		<h1 id="mythic%20gme%202e%20drama%20hack">Mythic GME 2E Drama Hack</h1>
		<p>The following changes made to the official rules for focus threads and chaos factor are meant to encourage a more self-contained story that feels akin to a single novel, movie, or episode. This method can be used in succession to create a series.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="focus%20threads">Focus Threads</h2>
		<blockquote>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• More than one focus thread is allowed—the primary overarching thread is referred to as the <em>Main Plot</em> thread and the rest are <em>Subplot</em> threads. Each is assigned a label along with their type, such as "Subplot: Find a Mentor."<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Retroactively creating a focus thread from a reoccurring theme is also allowed. On creation, fill in boxes on the progress track according to events that have already transpired, as if it had been tracked from the start.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subplot threads are nested. Subplot A and Subplot B are contained within the Main Plot, and Subplot A1 and Subplot A2 are contained within Subplot A, etc. A parent thread cannot be resolved until all of its child threads are resolved. Therefore, only create threads that are intended to be resolved before the conclusion of the Main Plot.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• For clarity of intent, threads have three properties that should be defined: <em>Premise</em> (the question or event that is expected to be resolved at the thread's conclusion), <em>Goal</em> (how the character intends to resolve it), and <em>Problem</em> (what is complicating their attempt).<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Additionally, the premise of each thread has an element type that helps specify which kind of notable events move the thread toward its conclusion, whether they be positive or negative: <em>Milieu</em> (driven by place), <em>Inquiry</em> (driven by answers), <em>Character</em> (driven by angst), and <em>Event</em> (driven by action). Ideally, each thread should be a different element.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Any scene that moves the thread closer to its conclusion, whether positively or negatively, counts as progress. Flashpoints are triggered only when an action is taken that will result in recording enough progress points to complete a phase (a 5-point block), regardless of whether they are recorded immediately or during the end of scene bookkeeping. Nothing else counts as a flashpoint.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Flashpoint random events are <em class="no-color">always</em> a dramatically negative development for the focus thread, and they must be generated before the end of the scene that triggered the flashpoint. The flashpoint random event may use the Current Context event focus when generated immediately following the action that triggered it, or it may roll on the event focus table when generated later in the scene (usually near the end, leading into the next scene).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<h2 id="chaos%20factor">Chaos Factor</h2>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>The chaos factor is set according to progress on the Main Plot focus thread track. CF starts at 5, then becomes 6 and 7 once it fills those boxes. CF resets to 5 again once the Main Plot thread is concluded. Subplot threads do not affect the chaos factor.<br>
		  10 points: <code>[5....][6..7.]</code><br>
		  15 points: <code>[5....][..6..][..7..]</code><br>
		  20 points: <code>[5....][....6][.....][.7...]</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<h2 id="fate%20questions">Fate Questions</h2>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Questions should be phrased so that a Yes answer is the most dramatic result, whether that is positive or negative for the PC. This way the drama increases toward the climax of the Main Plot focus thread, and then goes away during its resolution, or <em class="no-color">denouement</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<h2 id="focus%20threads%20examples">Focus Threads Examples</h2>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Main Plot:</strong> Anniversary Party <small><code>[5....][..6..][..7..]</code><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Premise:</strong> [Event] Seth and Erin have decided to throw a one-year anniversary celebration.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Goal:</strong> Throw a party in honor of the myths while keeping them from killing each other, or Seth.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Problem:</strong> The myths keep fighting among themselves.</small></p>
		  <p><strong>Subplot:</strong> Powerless <small><code>[.....][.....]</code><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Premise:</strong> [Character] Seth struggles with his inability to keep anyone safe.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Goal:</strong> Keep the humans out of harm's way.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Problem:</strong> The myths keep focusing their attention on Melody and Erin.</small></p>
