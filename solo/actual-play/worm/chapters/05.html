		<h2 id="chapter%205">Chapter 5</h2>
		<p>The sound of conversation and tinny explosions pulls me from my sleep. I open my eyes a crack to see Grue pacing back and forth in the lounge. Tattletale is seated beside me on the couch. My feet are resting on her lap with my head laid against the armrest.</p>
		<p>"Good morning, sleepy," Tattletale says as she pets my feet.</p>
		<p>"Hey," I murmur in a haze.</p>
		<p>I glance about the room while remaining sprawled across the couch. It seems the gang is all here. Imp and Regent are at the far end of the room, seated before a large television and viciously battling each other in some video game, the apparent source of the explosions that woke me. Shadow Stalker is seated diagonally in an armchair, a leg slung over the armrest and an arm laid across the headrest, feigning casualness while keeping a wary eye on Regent. Bitch is seated on the floor with Angelica and Bastard, hand-feeding them from a bag of dogfood that Grue keeps on hand for such a purpose.</p>
		<p>"It's about time you woke up, dork," Regent calls over his shoulder. "We've been waiting forever."</p>
		<p>I push myself up to a seated position. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"Pffft. Ignore him. You've had a rough day," Tattletale says, and pats my leg in consolation, "which is why we're here. Plans have obviously changed and we need to adjust."</p>
		<p>I groan and nod. "Yeah. The Pure is a bust. Though I'm not too heartbroken about that."</p>
		<p>Grue gives a half chuckle in agreement.</p>
		<p>Tattletale smirks. "Such a shame, right? But this does put a kink in Coil's plans and our fight against the Nine. We really needed that extra firepower."</p>
		<p>I grimace. Coil gave me one simple task, to recruit the help of The Pure, and I couldn't even do that. It wasn't through any fault of my own, but where does that put me? Will that be counted as a strike against me in his eyes, costing me ground in my mission to free Dinah? It's so difficult to tell with Coil.</p>
		<p>Tattletale frowns at me. "Stop that. I know what you're thinking. We'll fix this."</p>
		<p>"How?" Grue asks abruptly. "Who is left to recruit? Faultline's Crew? We're not dealing with those Chosen fuckers."</p>
		<p>"I don't think the Chosen are an option anyway," Tattletale says. "A little bird told me that they got taken out by Shatterbird last night. I think she may have attempted to recruit Hookwolf."</p>
		<p>"Fuuuck," Grue groans. "That's just what we need; to fight that asshole as part of the Nine."</p>
		<p>I shake my head. "We'll worry about that later. As for Faultline's Crew, I don't know how much help they'd be. Labyrinth is the only member with a strong power, and it's not an offensive one."</p>
		<p>Grue huffs a sigh. "Then I guess we're on our own."</p>
		<p>"No..," I say, almost a whisper. "There's another group."</p>
		<p>Tattletale leans forward. "Are you thinking the heroes?"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker lets out a long groan. "Fuck no. Not them."</p>
		<p>The three us of turn stare at her. Tattletale is the first to speak up. "That's not really your call to make."</p>
		<p>"Right?" calls Imp without tearing her eyes from the screen. "Why are you even here?"</p>
		<p>Grue crosses his arms. "That's actually a great question. I'd love to hear this."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker groans again and lays her head against the headrest, gazing at the ceiling. "Thanks to that fuckhead over there," her eyes flick to Regent, "I can't be a hero anymore. I can't even go back to being a vigilante because now I'm a fucking outlaw. I don't have a home either, thanks to him. I have nothing."</p>
		<p>Grue's voice is deep when he says, "If you're looking for a pity party, you won't find any here. We know the story between you and Skitter. I don't condone what Regent did, but you deserve everything you got."</p>
		<p>She glares at Grue. "I'll deal. I'm a survivor. I'm a predator."</p>
		<p>"I'm a <em>predator</em>," Imp mimics. "Sooo scary." Then she gasps. "Fuck, Regent! That was my power up, you dick!" Regent laughs.</p>
		<p>Tattletale rolls her eyes at the children then turns to Shadow Stalker. "What is it that you expect to get out of this?"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker shrugs. "A place to crash. A paycheck. Some villains to take out my aggression on."</p>
		<p>"We fight heroes too, you know," Tattletale reminds her.</p>
		<p>"The villains, the heroes, the cops. They're all after me whether I'm with you or on my own."</p>
		<p>"Look. The fact is, I don't trust you, Shadow Stalker. You're a horrible, hateful person," Tattletale says bluntly. "However, I do trust Skitter. Despite everything you've done to her, she is vouching for you. I can't understand it, honestly, but that's our Skitter. She believes in second chances. I don't. But I have faith in her, and through her, I am putting my faith you. Do <em>not</em> make me regret this."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker looks from Tattletale to me. I meet her eyes but don't respond. Her expression is difficult to read. It's angry—it's always angry—but there's something more. Reevaluating me?</p>
		<p>She returns her gaze to Tattletale and says harshly, "Fine."</p>
		<p>The conversation dies there and the only sounds in the room are those of the television and the tapping of buttons on game controllers. Awkwardly, I pipe up, "So, the heroes?"</p>
		<p>"Do you think they'll play ball?" Grue asks, turning his attention to me.</p>
		<p>"Maybe," Tattletale says. "They've been hands-off since we moved in, but it's their city too. It's their duty to protect it. The Slaughterhouse Nine technically classifies as an S-Class threat, so it makes sense that they'd call a truce to team up against them."</p>
		<p>"Should we contact them tonight?" I ask, hoping that the answer is no.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Tattletale think we should contact them right away? (Small Chance) [53] No, we should prepare first.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"No, Skitter," Tattletale says with a gentle smile and pats my leg. "Take the rest of the day off. Prepare. Heal. We can contact them tomorrow."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you can show Shadow Stalker her new quarters while you're at it," Grue suggests, sounding nonplussed.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker snorts and I frown at her. "Yeah, alright," I say, defeated. "I guess this was inevitable. Let's head back to my lair and get you situated."</p>
		<hr>
		<p>[That's it for now. Thanks for reading!] </p>
