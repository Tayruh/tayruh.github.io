# Cortex Prime

> **Traits:** distinctions + sfx, values + statements, attributes, powers, specialities, goals 
> **Character Creation:**  scratch-built
> **Growing Characters:** growth, growth by questioning traits, growth by recovery, growth by completing goals, growth-created relationship asset
> **Conflicts:** tests, contests, interfering, challenges, dramatic order, ganging up, urgent assets
> **Dice Rolling:** advantage of scale
> **Complications:** complications, stress, trauma, pushing stress, last-ditch effort
> **Plot Points:** starting plot points: 1
> **Game Narrator Characters:** bosses, extras, location GMCs, minor GMCs, catalysts

> **Distinctions:** The three distinctions are the character's role, personality, and background. Each are d8 and come with the standard SFX of "Hinder: Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction's die for a d4." Assign three more SFX across the three distinctions—ideally one to earn a PP and two that cost a PP. Premade SFX taken from Tales of Xadia.
> 
> **Relationships:** You are given one d10, two d8s, and two d6s to assigned to relationships. Each has a trait statement. All relationships not assigned a die are assumed to be d4.
> 
> **Attributes:** You are given three d8s and three d6s to be assigned to the attributes *Agility, Awareness, Intellect, Presence, Spirit, and Strength*. You may step down an attribute to step up another, but not below d4 or above d10.
> 
> **Power Sets:** The number of power sets are not fixed—humans usually have none, myths usually have only one, and more powerful myths have two or three. For each set you're given two d10s to be assigned to powers in that set. You may step down a power to add another power to that set at the same size. All power sets come with "Limit: Shut down a power in this set to gain a PP. Restore with an opportunity or in the next scene." If it doesn't make narrative sense to single out a power to be shut down, the entire set is shut down for only 1 PP. Power sets do not have SFX as they will be handled through distinction SFX.
> 
> **Specialties:** You're given two d10s to be assigned to the specialties *Craft, Drive, Fight, Fix, Fly, Focus, Influence, Know, Labor, Move, Notice, Operate, Perform, Shoot, Sneak, Survive, Throw, Treat, and Trick*. You may step down a specialty to add another specialty at the same size. Know must have an area of expertise, and requires an additional Know specialty for each additional area. 
> 
> **Stress:** The stress types are *Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, Injured, and Insecure*. Myths also have *Monstrous*.
> 
> **Goals:** You may have up to three goals active at once. Assign a goal by describing what you want to accomplish in connection with a relationship, then give it a die rating between d6 and d12 to represent its difficulty. Its rating cannot be higher than the connected relationship rating or the same as another active goal.
