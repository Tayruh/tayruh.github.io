		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Characters:</strong> Add <em>Mansion</em>, <em>Erin</em>, <em>Walter</em>, <em>Seoyun</em>, <em>Sera</em>, <em>Finola</em>, <em>Vanessa</em>, <em>Gray</em>, <em>Cami</em>, and <em>Jess</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Set to 5.</p>
		  <p><strong>First Scene:</strong> [PC Positive: Celebrate Work] We're celebrating a year of everyone being together.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It had been a full year since Erin and I took the position of housemaster for the mansion converted into a boarding house for monsters. We had decided to hold a celebration for our residents.</p>
		<p>My job for the day as the housemaster was to gather all of the residents for the festivities and ensure that everything proceeded smoothly. It was my hope that the lodgers would enjoy themselves and see just how much we appreciate them staying with us.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Where are we? [Dark / Cramped] In the basement.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> Why? [Harm / Decrease] Warning Hitomi.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I began with entering the mansion's basement where Hitomi usually liked to hide out. Hitomi was our resident <em>onryou</em>â€”a vengeful spirit from Japanese lore. She had issues with big changes or lots of activity, and I was worried that a party would freak her out.</p>
		<p>I called out her name.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she respond? (Very Likely) [54] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Hitomi passed through the basement wall and greeted me with a nervous smile. I smiled and returned the greeting while Hitomi fidgeted with her hands.</p>
		<p>Hitomi held the appearance of a young girl, possibly sixteen or seventeen years old. I had never asked her age, though I did know that she died in her second-to-last last year of high school. In fact, Hitomi still wore her Japanese school uniform, which consisted of a navy blue plaid skirt, a similarly colored blazer over a white dress shirt, and a large red bow at her collar. The state of her uniform changed with her mood, ranging from pristine to ragged, muddy, and bloody. Thankfully, today her outfit looked as though it had been freshly pressed.</p>
		<p>"Today we'll be having a party to celebrate our one year anniversary of new management. I'm sorry if we get too noisy, but you're welcome to join us," I said.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she decide to join? (Likely) [54] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Hitomi gave a meek nod, then tucked behind her ear the strands of her long silky black hair that had fallen loose. "I would like that. Thank you." </p>
		<p>She gave a slight bow and disappeared into the wall before I could say anything further.</p>
		<p>"Okay, I'll see you upstairs!" I called out to the empty basement. I headed upstairs myself.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What do I find? [Naturally Boring] Vanessa.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is she doing? [Struggle / Strange] She's having trouble with something.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Happily Faded] Finola is drunk.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As I made it to the top of the stairs, Finola zipped by me in a streak of golden light. The mischievous faerie was clearly buzzed and giggled madly.</p>
		<p>Our shoggoth housemaid appeared from the kitchen holding a cake, looking just as prim and proper as always. Vanessa was outfitted in her typical maid uniform of a black dress beneath a white ruffled apron with a matching headdress. </p>
		<p>Vanessa had never been able to pass for human though, and her hair was an odd shape, like she used too much hair gel, and looked wet to the touch. Her pale blue complexion also had a slightly moist sheen.</p>
		<p>Our maid carefully steadied the cake in one hand as only a shoggoth could, by separating her hand into a mass of tentacles that supported the center of the tray while also firmly gripping the edges all around the tray.</p>
		<p>Finola caught sight of the cake and her eyes grew wide like saucers. The tiny faerie dive bombed the cake with a manic laugh.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Finola:</strong> She goes for the cake. (Mischievous d8, Vanessa d4, Flight d10, Move d10) [1, 3, 6 10] =  16 (d4). Take <em>Intoxicated</em> d6 complication and +1 PP (2) from hitch.</p>
		  <p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> She attempts to knock Finola out of the air. (Shoggoth d8, Fionnuala d6, Agility d6, Metamorphosis d10, Intoxicated d6) [1, 2, 1, 7, 5] = 12 (d6). Take <em>Caked</em> d8 complication and +1 PP (2) from hitches. Take no stress from failure.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Vanessa saw Finola coming and morphed her hand into something similar to a large fly swatter in an attempt to bat her out of the air. The drunken faerie laughed like a maniac as she defty dodged the fly swatter hand and plowed into the cake. The cake practically exploded all over Vanessa, but she remained stoic.</p>
		<p>I frowned at Vanessa. "Do you need help?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she? (50/50) [3] Exceptional yes. <br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What does she need help with? [Overthrow Balance] I'm not sure what this is referring to.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What does Balance refer to? [Frantically Familiar] Finola. She keeps countering all of Vanessa's attempts to prepare for the celebration.</p>
		  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Give <em>Distract Finola</em> d6 goal to Seth based on Vanessa relationship.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Vanessa bowed to me. Caked dripped off her face and onto the floor. "Yes, master. If you could keep Finola distracted, it would be of great help to me."</p>
		<p>I looked down at Finola. She gazed up at me happily as she mashed the cake like a baby at their first birthday party. Her golden hair and pointy ears were barely visible beneath the mass of chocolate, and her ornate green and white dress was absolutely ruined.</p>
		<p>"C'mon, Finola." I reached for the miniature girl.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she try to avoid me? (Very Unlikely) [29] Nope. She lets me pick her up.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Finola giggled as I retrieved her from the cake disaster and plopped her on my shoulder. She clung desperately to my shirt as she weebled and wobbled on her perch. With her wings caked inâ€¦cake, she wasn't going to be flying any time soon.</p>
