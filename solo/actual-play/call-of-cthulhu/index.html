		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Tension:</strong> set to 0 (initial)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah and Chelsea are lounging around in their living room and watching TV. They receive a knock on the door, and when they go to answer it, no one is there. On the door step is an envelope.</p>
		<p>Sarah brings the envelope inside and opens it. The letter is from a Mr. Knott who requests that you examine the old <em>Corbitt House</em> in central Boston. The former tenants, the Macario family, were involved in a tragedy and he has been unable to rent the estate since. Inside the envelope is also the keys to estate, the address, and $25 cash in advance.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does Sarah feel about this?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li>She's eager for work. (Probably) [18]</li>
		  <li>She's wary of the benefactor. (Pretty Sure) [18]</li>
		  <li><strong>She's curious about the house. (Maybe) [12]</strong></li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does Chelsea feel about this?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>Would rather keep watching TV. (Pretty Sure) [6]</strong></li>
		  <li>Doesn't really care and will follow Sarah's lead. (Maybe) [10]</li>
		  <li>Suggests that if they do this, she'll take the lead on it. (Who knows?) [19]</li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah shows the envelope to Chelsea but she couldn't care less. She just waves Sarah away so she can keep watching TV.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does Sarah convince Chelsea to come with her?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>She turns off the TV and commands her. (Maybe Not) [7]</strong></li>
		  <li>She convinces her that it'll be fun. (Probably) [9]</li>
		  <li>She rationally explains that they need this money. (Probably) [8]</li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah rudely shuts off the television and stands there with her hands on her hips like a mom. Chelsea sits up on the couch. "What the fuck, Sarah?"</p>
		<p>Sarah angrily explains to Chelsea that their rent is due and this is currently their only means of employment. Chelsea has had long enough to rest between jobs but now it's time to get to work now that they finally got a request.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Tension:</strong> increases to 1 (conflict with Chelsea)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Chelsea groans and lays back on the couch. "Fine. Then where are we going?"</p>
		<p>Sarah suggests that they look into the history of the house and the tragedy that Mr. Corbitt spoke of. The best places to look for that information would probably be the Boston Globe, the Central Library, or the Hall of Records. They could always just go check out the house itself, but that seems kind of useless without knowing the history first.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where should they go?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li>Boston Globe (Probably) [7]</li>
		  <li>Central Library (Probably) [14]</li>
		  <li><strong>Hall of Records (Maybe) [3]</strong></li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah and Chelsea arrive at the Hall of Records, having driven there in Sarah's car.</p>
		<p>The Hall of Records is enormous and it's easy to get overwhelmed. The pair begin hunting for information regarding the house and Corbitt.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Sarah <strong>Library Use</strong> check (20): [49] Success</p>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Library Use</strong> check (60): [61] Fail</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Sarah actually failed since her Library Use is 20%. I brainfarted and thought it was 50, but I don't feel like changing the story now. Sarah gets a freebie this time.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Oh, I think I have something," Sarah says after digging through mountains of books. "It says here that the executor of Walter Corbitt's will was Reverend Michael Thomas, the pastor of the Chapel of Contemplation and Church of Our Lord Granter of Secrets."</p>
		<p>"The Church of the what now?"</p>
		<p>"Our Lord Granter of Secrets. I feel like I'm reciting a cult oath just being saying the name." Sarah sighs. "Well, let's look that up too."</p>
		<p>It doesn't take long before they look up with little information is available on the church. According to the register, the chapel was closed in 1912. There are references to criminal actions in the court records, but there are no actual records of those actions present.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Sarah <strong>Law</strong> check (5): [87] Fail</p>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Law</strong> check (5): [99] Fumble</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning</strong> check (Action) for fumble: Imprison Travel</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"I don't get it," Chelsea says. "Where are the records? Do we need to visit the police station?"</p>
		<p>"It couldn't hurt. It's a criminal affair after all, so maybe the records exist there."</p>
		<p>The girls take their leave of the Hall of Records and make their way to the Central Police Station.</p>
		<p>A few moments later they arrive at the police station.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is this a problem for Chelsea? (Probably)<br>
		  <strong>A:</strong> [9-1] Yes</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Ehhh, I hate this place," Chelsea says. "I've had a few unplanned visits here."</p>
		<p>Sarah sighs. "Yeah, I remember."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What did Chelsea do?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li>Public nudity. (Maybe) [17]</li>
		  <li><strong>Social disturbance. (Probably) [1]</strong></li>
		  <li>Violence. (Maybe Not) [19]</li>
		  <li>Theft. (Maybe) [4]</li>
		  <li>Drunk in public. (Probably) [15]</li>
		  </ol>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Was the disturbance from partying with her friends? (Pretty Sure)<br>
		  <strong>A:</strong> [13] Yes</p>
		  <p><strong>Tension:</strong> increase to 2 (Chelsea has a record)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Ah well. You only live once, right?" she says with a grin.</p>
		<p>"And not for very long, at your rate."</p>
		<p>They walk up the steps to the police station and enter. The place is bustling. Before them lies the reception desk. Sarah takes the lead and approaches it.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Identity</strong>: Receptionist<br>
		  <strong>Personality:</strong> Politely Young<br>
		  <strong>Activity:</strong> Technology</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah introduces herself to the receptionist and inquires about the missing files in the Hall of Records. The young receptionist looks uncomfortable. "We can't just hand files out to the public, ma'am."</p>
		<p>"C'mooonn," Chelsea says, touching the back of his hand, causing the young man to blush. "Just let us have a little peek. No one has to know. It'll just be between you…and me." she gives a seductive smile.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Charm</strong> check (50): [51] Fail</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"M-Ma'am, that is unprofessional and very distracting." He takes his hand back and adjust his collar. </p>
		<p>Chelsea gives him a look that could kill, which quickly dissolves into a gentle smile. "Don't be that way. We're just trying to help a friend of ours. He runs the Corbitt House. Perhaps you've heard of it?" She grasps his hand and gives him the most dramatic puppy dog eyes. "Our poor friend, he's afraid that some really shady things have gone down in that house and we're just trying to alay his fears. We found references in the Hall of Records, but the mentioned files are missing. Isn't that <em>weeeeeird?</em>" She pets the back of his hand. "So if you could just let us see that file, you'd be a hero. You'd be <em>my</em> hero."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Charm</strong> check (50): [16] Pass</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"Oh, uh, well, I mean, I guess, umm..," the poor man stammers. </p>
		<p>Chelsea grins. He was all hers now.</p>
		<p>"I'll, uh, I'll be right with that, um, that file…for you." He quickly abandons the reception desk and heads towards their records department.</p>
		<p>Chelsea turns to Sarah once he's out of ear shot, fire in her eyes. "Did you hear that fucker turn me down? I should have punched his teeth in."</p>
		<p>"Chelsea."</p>
		<p>"That is <em>unprofessional</em>, he says. Fucking virgin." She continues to fume.</p>
		<p>Sarah groans and rubs her temples.</p>
		<p>Chelsea is still angrily pacing when the receptionist returns. </p>
		<p>"I have that file for you!" he says.</p>
		<p>Chelsea's expression becomes one of adoration. "Oh thank you, sweetie! You're a doll." She can hear an audible groan coming from Sarah's direction but she ignores it. "Now, let's see what we have here."</p>
		<p>Sarah peers over Chelsea's shoulder at the file. The file describes a raid of the Chapel of Contemplation after the church was accused of abducting children. There was a shoot out that resulted in the deaths of seventeen cult members and three policemen. The autopsies of the members seem to have been glossed over, if they were completed at all, as the details are general at best. 54 members of the church were arrested, however all but eight were released. There was also interference by some local official that was privy unreleased information. And finally, Pastor Michael Thomas was sentenced to 40 years in jail for second degree murder, but had apparently escaped and fled the state in 1917.</p>
		<p>"Wow, that's a lot of bad shit. That pastor is a bad character," says Chelsea.</p>
		<p>Sarah nods slowly. "And he was the executor of Corbitt's will. That means he was given responsibility to care for the estate after Corbitt died? Corbitt trusted that creep this much? That is super sketchy."</p>
		<p>"Well," Chelsea says, "it looks like we have some options. We can go straight to Corbitt House, ask around town, or visit that crazy ass church. What do you think?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <ol>
		  <li>Visit the Corbitt House (Probably) [15]</li>
		  <li>Ask around town. (Maybe) [15]</li>
		  <li><strong>Visit the Church of Contemplation. (Pretty Sure) [16]</strong></li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"We should hit that church. It feels really important to our case."</p>
		<p>"Alright, we're out of here, sweetie," Chelsea says to the receptionist as she hands him the file. "Thanks for your help. Take care." She waves behind her as she and Sarah leave.</p>
		<p>"C-Call me!" the receptionist shouts after her, which elicits a laugh from Chelsea.</p>
		<br>
		<h1 id="scene%202">Scene 2</h1>
		<p>"Well.. Here it is. The Church of Contemplation," Sarah announces as the two of the girls walk up the concrete path leading toward the church. </p>
		<p>The grounds are overrun with weeds and grass, and the building looks on the verge of collapse. It appears that no one has been here in decades.</p>
		<p>"Good lord, what a dump. What are we even expecting to find here?" Chelsea punts a chunk of the crumbled foundation off the path.</p>
		<p>"Some clue as to what happened the night of the fire and shootout."</p>
		<p>"Okay, that's one mystery. And don't get me wrong, that pastor is a major creep, but what does this have to do with Corbitt? Other than the pastor having control of the Corbitt property, there's no proof that Corbitt was here that night right?"</p>
		<p>"Well," Sarah says with a shrug, "That's what we're hoping to find out."</p>
		<p>As they near the entrance to the ruined church, they pass what looks like graffiti painted on a crumbling wall. The graffiti is a symbol with three Ys positioned to form a triangle with an eye placed in the center. Sarah and Chelsea think nothing of it until a strong and oppressive tingling sensation forms in their forehead as they look at the symbol. The sensation slowly becomes a nagging headache.</p>
		<p>"Uggh. What the heck..," Sarah murmurs, pressing her palm to her forehead.</p>
		<p>"Oof. I suddenly feel like I have a hangover. Where is is coming from?" Chelsea says.</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure but the feeling seems to be located in just this area of the courtyard. Let's just move along."</p>
		<p>Chelsea agrees and they continue toward the church. The feeling dissipates as they do so.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Sarah and Chelsea enter the remains of the church.</li>
		<li>While searching the remains, the ground gives way and the girls are forced to leap to safety.</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Sarah <strong>Luck</strong> check (45): [17] Pass<br>
		  Chelsea <strong>Luck</strong> check (55): [77] Fail</p>
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
		<li>Sarah reacts in time but Chelsea is a bit late. She grasps for the edge of the hole as she falls.</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Jump</strong> check (20): [83] Fail</p>
		  <p>Chelsea takes <strong>4</strong> damage from the fall. HP decreases to <strong>9</strong>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
		<li>Chelsea is unable to get a hold of the edge and tumbles into the hole.</li>
		<li>Chelsea curses like a sailor as she rises back to her feet. Sarah calls out to her and Chelsea confirms that she's okay. Sarah climbs down into the hole with her.</li>
		<li>This area is apparently a section of the basement that was sealed off from the rest of the house.</li>
		<li>Next to a cabinet are two skeletons wearing silk robes.</li>
		<li>Chelsea searches the skeletons but finds nothing. However she does notice that the robes contain a symbol matching the one painted outside.</li>
		<li>Sarah searches the cabinet and discovers a bunch of books, but none of them seem particularly useful.</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do they look under the cabinet?</p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>Sarah (Probably) [5]</strong></li>
		  <li>Chelsea (Maybe) [12]</li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
		<li>Sarah discovers a journal and an old tome under the cabinet.</li>
		<li>The journal says that Corbitt was buried in the basement of his house "in accordance to his will and the wishes of the one that waits in the dark."</li>
		<li>The tome is <em>Liber Ivonis</em> which is written entirely in Latin. Unfortunately neither of them can read Latin. They take the book along anyway.</li>
		<li>The next location seems obvious. However, they could still ask around town to gather more info if they wanted.</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do they ask around town? (Maybe)<br>
		  <strong>A:</strong> [13] No</p>
		</blockquote>
		<ul>
		<li>The girls decide to head straight to the Old Corbitt Place. If the place is haunted because there is a body in the basement, then this should be easy work.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h1 id="scene%203">Scene 3</h1>
		<ul>
		<li>They arrive at Corbitt Place. The building is nestled into the shadows of its neighboring structures. The window shades are drawn shut and make it impossible to see inside. The front door has a single lock with four additional bolts that have been recently added.</li>
		<li>Sarah turns to Chelsea and shrug. She removes the key from her pocket and unlocks the door. "Here we go."</li>
		</ul>
		<p>They find themselves in a dark hallway. Chelsea hits the light switch in the hallway and the overhead lamp flickers to life.</p>
		<p>"Looks like the power bill is still getting paid," she says.</p>
		<p>"Thank God. I can't believe we didn't think to bring a flash light with us."</p>
		<p>With the hallway illuminated they can see a row of three doors on the left and two on the right. Without any indication which each room is, they decide to check each room in succession.</p>
		<p>The first door on the left is a room full of junk and boxes. Completely useless things like an old rusty bicycle. On the opposite side of the room is a cabinet. The cabinet is boarded shut.</p>
		<p>"Why would this be boarded up?" Sarah asks.</p>
		<p>"Who cares? I don't think Corbitt is hiding in there. Let's just dig his ass up and get this over with."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Would Sarah be curious enough to try opening the cabinet anyway? (Maybe Not) <br>
		  <strong>A:</strong> [5] Yes</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Ignoring Chelsea's whining, Sarah finds a random piece of metal amidst the junk and is able to pry the cabinet open. Inside the cabinet she finds three diaries belonging to various inhabitants of the Corbitt house. One is by a W. Corbitt.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God..," Sarah says in exasperation. "This thing is a damn novel. And it looks like it's written by a mad man. It'd take me days to decipher this crap."</p>
		<p>"Ain't nobody got time for that."</p>
		<p>"For real." Sarah tosses the diary into her bag, most likely to never be looked at again.</p>
		<p>The next room is even more boxes of junk. Just another useless storage room. Chelsea groans.</p>
		<p>In the center of the following room is a stove, across from which is the side entrance door. The door is secured with three bolts and two locks. The room itself is contains racks with coats and umbrellas hanging from them, along with a line of golashes. Sarah comments on the extreme security on the side door, but otherwise there isn't much to make of this room, so the two girls move on to the next.</p>
		<p>They enter what appears to be the living room. At first inspection, it looks like your typical living room; stuffed chairs, a couch, a television. However, lining the walls are shelves, and upon those shelves are many knickknacks.They immediately draw Sarah and Chelsea's attention.</p>
		<p>"I guess the Macario family was religious? This feels a bit overzealous though." Chelsea asks, observing the many crucifixes and other catholic items.</p>
		<p>A large thump comes from over their heads and it startles Chelsea enough to drop the cross that she was playing with. Rather than investigating the sound, the girls pause and listen. A few moments go by and there is nothing else, and so they decide to dismiss it.</p>
		<p>They enter the door on the wall adjacent to the hallway entrance and it leads them to a dining room. It looks like your typical dining room and they find nothing unexpected, and so they move on to the kitchen, which also looks exactly as they expected. To their dismay, however, there is also some food left behind by the previous tenants which is rotting and rat eaten.</p>
		<p>"So… they're trying to rent this place, right?" Chelsea asks, grimacing at the food. "Exactly how were they expecting to get prospective renters while the place is still full of shit like broken bikes, clothing, fuckloads of crucifixes, and rotting food? Were they just going to haul this all away at the last moment?"</p>
		<p>Sarah just shrugs. She'd been forming the same question and didn't have an answer either. "You know, we never did get the full story on what the supposed tragedy was that befell the Macario family, nor why the public thinks it's haunted. Perhaps Mr. Knott is having difficulties getting a cleaning crew to accept the job."</p>
		<p>"Well. I'm sure glad that we accepted without even the most minute amount of research into the history of this place. I'm sure it'll turn out just fine."</p>
		<p>"Mmm. In hindsight, we should have probably asked around town before coming here." Sarah sighs. "Well, at least that's the last of the first floor. Nowhere to go but up now."</p>
		<p>As they enter the hallway, Chelsea notices a door opposite the stairway to the second floor. "Huh. That must go to the cellar, right?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah..," Sarah says. "We can explore that after. I'm curious about the noise coming from upstairs."</p>
		<p>Chelsea shrugs and follows Sarah up the stairs. </p>
		<p>After ascending the stairs they are greeted with a row of four doors lining the left wall. They take the first door and find themselves in a small bathroom. It's as disgusting and abandoned as the rest of the house and so they decide to move on.</p>
		<p>They find themselves in what appears to be the spare bedroom for guests. The room is plain and all surfaces are covered in dust as expected, yet something feels off. Sarah immediately gets a chill and there is a horrible smell emanating from somewhere.</p>
		<p>"What the fuck is that smell?" Chelsea asks, burying her nose in the pit of her elbow.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Disturbance:</strong></p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><strong>Bed (1-2): [2]</strong></li>
		  <li>Blood (3-4)</li>
		  <li>Window rattle (5)</li>
		  <li>Noises (6)</li>
		  </ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"I think it's coming from the bed..," Sarah says as she steps closer to it.</p>
		<p>As Sarah nears the bed, the window begins rattling violently like something is trying to break through.</p>
		<p>"What the hell?" Chelsea asks. Not one to be intimidated, she approaches the window. Once she is standing before it, the rattling stops. Confused, she presses her hand against the glass in an attempt to replicate the rattling.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Chelsea <strong>Spot Hidden</strong> check: [53] + 3 Luck. Success.<br>
		  Chelsea <strong>Dodge</strong> check: [43] + 3 Luck. Success.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Chelsea senses motion over her shoulder and Sarah screams a warning. Chelsea jumps away from the window just as the bed crashes through it and smashes into pieces on the ground below. The window is now a gaping hole in the wall.</p>
		<p>"Holy crap…," Chelsea says, resting on her elbows from a prone position. "I thought I was fucking dead."</p>
		<p>"Yeah..," Sarah says in disbelief, unable to look away from the hole.</p>
		<p>Chelsea stands and dusts herself off. "We're not paying for that, right? Knott can go fuck himself if he thinks we are."</p>
		<p>Before Sarah can respond, her attention is caught by what appears to be blood seeping up from the floor boards where the bed used to be. </p>
		<p>"Nope. Uh uh. We're done here. Fuck this room," Chelsea says as she quickly trots out of the bedroom and into the hallway.</p>
		<p>Chelsea stomps off toward the stairs and Sarah calls out to her from the bedroom doorway. "Where are you going?"</p>
		<p>Chelsea stops and spins toward Sarah. "To the basement. The journal said that he was buried there, right? Let's just get this over with."</p>
		<p>Chelsea turns and heads down the stairs. Unable to dispute that logic, Sarah follows.</p>
		<p>The pair open the door to the basement and are greeted with a pitch black stairwell. Sarah reaches above the first step and pulls the chain to the overhead lamp.  With the darkness banished, they descend the stairs.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Sarah:</strong> DEX check (70): [47] Pass</p>
		  <p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> DEX check (40): [45] Fail</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah leads the way down the stairs. Behind her she hears Chelsea yelps as she loses her footing. She grasps for the railing.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> DEX check (40): [71] Fail</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"What?" Chelsea shouts in surprise as the railing bends of its own will moves out of her grasp. Unable to get a hold, she tumbles down the stairs toward Sarah.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Sarah:</strong> DEX check (70): [38] Pass</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Sarah barely dodges and Chelsea hits the bottom of the stairs.</p>
