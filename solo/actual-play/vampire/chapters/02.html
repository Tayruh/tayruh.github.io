<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the next scene as expected? (Yes/And,
Straight, Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [6, 6, 6, Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the
Big Bad or other forces aligned against the main characters and their
interests] I expected the characters to sneak into the castle, and I
expected it to be dangerous, but it's made worse because the members
that left Charlotte's coven have joined this one and are expecting
her.</p>
<ul>
<li>Castle
<ul>
<li><strong>Locations:</strong> 1-4: Expected, 5-6: Hallway, 7: Random,
8: Rest Area, 9: Expected, 10: Dining Room, 11: Throne Room, 12:
Barracks, 13: Corinna</li>
<li><strong>Encounters:</strong> 1-3: None, 4-5: Guard, 6: None, 7:
Random, 8: Friendly, 9: Boss</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte and company arrived at the castle just after nightfall.
Rather than approaching the gate, the group traversed to the darkest
corner of the castle wall. The castle walls may keep out humans but they
were nothing to vampires.</p>
<p>Katherine latched onto Vincent's back with her arms wrapped tightly
around his shoulders. Charlotte gave side-eyed looks from apparent
jealousy, but there wasn't any other way to get the human over the
wall.</p>
<p>The cobblestone walls of the castle provided convenient handholds and
Vincent and Charlotte quickly ascended to the top of the wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a lookout at the top? (Mixed, Straight,
Favorability)<br />
<strong>Story</strong> [3, 2, 4] Not here at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They couldn't be sure that there weren't guards posted at other
stations along the castle wall, but they were fortunate enough to select
an unguarded section of the wall. They were safe for now.</p>
<p>The trio descended the near stairs and entered the castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte know where she's going? (Mixed,
Straight, Favorability)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [3, 3, 2] Sort of. She's only heard rumors, so
she only has a general idea where Corinna might be held, and she isn't
even sure if it's good intel.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [5+0, 4+0] Hallway and guards.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Charlotte spot them first?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [5,2,6] = 11
(d6)<br />
<strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8 + Alertness d10 + Duty
d8 + Vampire d10: [4,10,7,5] = 17 (d10) + Heroic Success</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Charlotte immediately spotted
a pair of guards at the end of the hallway. Thankfully they didn't spot
her as well and she managed to sneak into the doorway off to the side.
She turned back and waved the others on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Vincent make it?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [4,6,6] = 12
(d8)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8 + Agility d6 + Duty d10 + Vampire
d8: [4,4,1,5] = 13 (d4) + Hitch; Spent 1 PP to keep extra die and had to
take d4 effect die.<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> What is the hitch?<br />
<strong>What:</strong> [Witnessed Information] The guard saw evidence of
entry; bought for 1 PP. It'll be a "Suspicious d6" complication if they
come back through this hallway.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Katherine make it?<br />
<strong>Difficulty:</strong> 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: [5,6,5] = 11
(d8)<br />
<strong>Katherine:</strong> Blood Sacrifice d8 + Agility d8 + Glory d4:
[8,4,2] = 12 (d4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three of them sneaked past the guard but Vincent bumped an end
table on the way out and it caught the guard's attention. The trio were
already long gone, but the guard had become suspicious and going back
this way would be difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [3+1,1+1] Expected location and no
encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next room that they entered was empty. It was a fairly
nondescript room with nothing of interest so they continued through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [2+2,4+2] Expected location and no
encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following room appeared to be more of the same. Charlotte was
beginning to wonder if she actually knew where she was going. Perhaps
she had bad intel after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> [1+3,5+3] Expected location and friendly
encounter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Margaret</strong> (Blood Mage)
<ul>
<li>Identity: Wizard</li>
<li>Descriptor: Longing For The Younger Years and Striking</li>
<li>Traits: Frightened; Exacting; Unaware of own limitations</li>
<li>Goals: Execute Poverty; Convey Propaganda; Oppress others</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does she look?<br />
<strong>Adjective:</strong> [Powerfully Fiery] She has bright red hair
that stands out against her pale skin. She's very beautiful and exudes a
sense of power from her presence.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is she as expected? (Mixed, Straight,
Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 1, 6] I expected Margeret to be friendly
towards Vincent rather than Charlotte, which would make her jealous. The
oracle agrees and sets the drama level to high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if to answer her concerns, the next turn led them straight into a
command room, not unlike her own. In it was a desk and behind it stood
Margaret.</p>
<p>The red-haired woman appeared to have been glancing over some
documents on their arrival, but her head snapped up to spot them the
moment that they appeared.</p>
<p>"Why, if it isn't my lovely Vincent. How are you, my sweet?" The
voluptuous woman gracefully skirted around the desk and latched onto his
arm. Margaret beamed at him but then her smile withered into a grimace
once she glanced over his shoulder. "Oh. I see your keeper tagged along
as well."</p>
<p>"Hello, Margaret," Charlotte said flatly and unamused.</p>
<p>Margaret ignored Charlotte and returned her attention to Vincent. "I
haven't seen you in ages. What brings you to my humble lair?"</p>
<p>"We came to retrieve something of ours," Vincent said
matter-of-factly. Charlotte gasped at how he showed their hand.</p>
<p>Margaret rubbed her cheek on Vincent's shoulder like a kitten.
"Something? Or some<em>one</em>?" she asked, peering up at him to search
his face.</p>
<p>When he didn't answer she just sighed. "Why her? Corinna has been
ours for decades and you only just now come to her rescue. What
changed?"</p>
<p>"If you must know," Charlotte said as she stepped forward and gave
Margaret a light shove to separate her from Vincent, "we are leaving
this city and we're not leaving her behind."</p>
<p>Margaret giggled and let Charlotte push her away, happy to have
gotten the reaction that she was looking for.</p>
<p>"Do you know where she is?" Vincent asked Margaret.</p>
<p>"Hmmm.. I don't know. Do I?" the red-head feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>"Margaret. Please," Vincent said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can he convince Margaret?<br />
<strong>Margaret:</strong> 2d8 + Sucker for Vincent d4: [5,2,2] = 7
(d4)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Servant d8 + Willpower d10 + Duty d10:
[6,1,10] = 16 (d4) + Heroic Success + Hitch<br />
<strong>Hitch:</strong> Margaret demands to tag along; bought for 1
PP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was quiet for a minute, as if weighing her options, and then a
smile crept across her face. "I will show you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'show us'?" Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>"I will guide you." Margaret glomped onto Vincent's arm. "After all,
I can't let my Vinciepoo fall into a trap, can I? I would worry so!"</p>
<p>Charlotte narrowed her eyes. "Lead the way, tramp."</p>
<p>Margaret cackled as she practically dragged Vincent out of the room
by his elbow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do they make it to Corinna without incident?
(Mixed, Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 5, 6] They manage to avoid any suspicion,
but Charlotte has had about enough of Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What does the room look like?<br />
<strong>Descriptor:</strong> [Perfectly Lonely] The room contains only
Corinna and not much else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The group traveled through the castle, following Margaret's lead.
Charlotte was loath to admit it, but having Margaret declare their path
was crucial, since she not only knew the exact location Corinna, but
also the location of all guard patrols. They didn't meet a soul on their
way to where Corinna was sealed.</p>
<p>"Well, this is drab," Charlotte said upon arriving as their
destination.</p>
<p>The room was a dark holding cell. There was absolutely nothing to see
other than an elaborately decorated coffin in the center of the
room.</p>
<p>"A coffin? I thought those were just fiction," Katherine said.</p>
<p>"They <em>are</em> fiction. Vanessa thinks that she's being cute,"
Charlotte said while grimacing at Margaret. Margaret just smiled and
shrugged.</p>
<p>Vincent stepped toward the box. "Right. So, how do we do this?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How <em>are</em> they going to do this?<br />
<strong>How:</strong> [Reception of Magic] Margaret magically charges
Katherine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Well, we need Katherine, first of all," Charlotte began, "and then
we need a touch of magic. I was going to attempt the act myself since
Corinna has taught me a little bit of sorcerery, buuut...," she turned
to Margaret, "we have had the fortune of being graced with our very one
blood mage. Haven't we, dear?"</p>
<p>Margaret laughed. "Oh, please. You know that I have the skill, but
it's going to take more than the blood of a virgin to wake your precious
Corinna."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How is Katherine's blood special?<br />
<strong>How:</strong> [Kill Ancestor] She's related to Vanessa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I know," Charlotte said.</p>
<p>"I don't think you do. This wasn't just any spell that put her under;
the spell was tied to Vanessa's blood. You can't break the seal without
it."</p>
<p>"That's incorrect. It was tied to her bloodline, not her blood."</p>
<p>"Sure, but Vanessa is a vampire. She doesn't have descendants."</p>
<p>Charlotte grinned like the cat that got the cream. "Wrong again!"</p>
<p>Margaret was quiet as she took this in.</p>
<p>"Vanessa had a child?" she finally asked.</p>
<p>Charlotte shrugged. "Seems like." Then she waved her arm in the
directly of Katherine. "Allow me to introduce to you the last living
descendant of Vanessa."</p>
<p>Margaret turned her attention the young blonde and looked her up and
down.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but who is Vanessa?" Katherine asked, shrinking back from
Margaret's scrutinizing gaze.</p>
<p>"She's our princess," Margaret answered. "She rules our coven."</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed. "<em>Your</em> coven? You leech."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Margaret waved a hand in dismissal. "They provide room
and board in exchange for my services. I may not be a vampire, but this
is the closest thing I've had to a home since... well.. you know."</p>
<p>Charlotte glared. "Yes, I know."</p>
<p>Vincent coughed. "Right then. Can we do this now?"</p>
<p>Margaret sighed. "Yeah, fine." She turned to Katherine. "Girl, hold
your wrist out over the coffin."</p>
<p>Katherine gulped but complied. She held her delicate wrist directly
above a golden rose emblazoned on the lid of the coffin. Margaret held
Katherine's wrist with in hand and broke her pale skin with the
thumbnail of her other. Katherine hissed at the sharp pain.</p>
<p>Margaret whisped words in an ancient language as blood trickled from
Katherine's wrist and pooled on the rose. It traveled along the grooves
of the intricate engraving. When the petals had been outlined by
Katherine's blood, the blood glowed softly and the lid popped with a
gentle click.</p>
<p>"Wow... It's true," Margaret said as she looked at Katherine once
more.</p>
<p>Katherine took her arm back and held her wrist, putting pressure on
the wound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Corinna wake immediately? (Yes/And,
Straight, Drama)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [6, 6, 5; Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the
Big Bad or other forces aligned against the main characters and their
interests.] Oops. Yeah, she's awake and pissed. She also manages to
alert the guards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the sound of splintering wood, a small fist thrust up through
the lid of the coffin, snapped it in two, and blew it off its hinges.
The coffin was vacated faster than even Charlotte could see and that
small hand held Margaret against the wall by her throat. Margaret's feet
kicked as she dangled and grasped at her throat, trying to pry Corinna's
steel grip from her trachea.</p>
<p>"Betrayer!" Corinna shouted with a guttural growl. The petite vampire
radiated power and fury. Magically charged currents circled her,
whipping her long black hair, through which peered eyes that glittered
gold in the light.</p>
<p>"Cor--" was all Margaret could get out before Corinna squeezed
tighter and cut off any ability to speak.</p>
<p>"I should kill you right now," Corinna hissed.</p>
<p>Vincent spoke up. "Corinna. Margaret is the one that freed you."</p>
<p>Corinna whipped her head toward Vincent and glared intensely. Without
looking, she pushed Margaret harder against the wall, causing her to
whimper. Corinna then turned to Charlotte. "Is this true?"</p>
<p>Charlotte shrugged and sighed. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>Corinna returned her gaze to Margaret. The red-head's struggling was
becoming slow and clumsy. She looked like she was about to pass out.
Corinna observed her, still seething with rage. Then as Margaret's eyes
were beginning to roll back into her head, Corinna opened her palm wide
and let the woman fall to the ground in a heap.</p>
<p>Katherine had hid behind Vincent and watched the violent display.
Unconsciously she whispered to herself, "She's just a little
girl..."</p>
<p>"Who's a little girl?" Corinna's voice came from just behind her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Katherine froze.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does she panic? (Mixed, Straight, Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [1, 4, 3] She keeps her cool and manages to not
provoke Corinna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Whats the matter?" the voice of the child whispered into her ear, so
close that her breath tickled. "Are you frightened of a <em>little
girl</em>?"</p>
<p>Katherine remained silent and motionless.</p>
<p>Corinna sniffed her. "You smell amazing. Do you know that?" she
asked. Katherine only whimpered in reply.</p>
<p>"Corinna, dear. You don't want that one," Charlotte said.</p>
<p>Corinna frowned. "Why not?"</p>
<p>"This is Vanessa's descendant."</p>
<p>"Ha..!" A laugh caught in Corinna's throat. Then she laughed like a
mad woman. Her laughter echoed off the walls.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a pair of patrolling guards heard her laughter down
the hall and ran into the room to check the disturbance. One of the men
spotted the broken coffin and immediately darted out of the room and
around the corner. Seconds later the sound of something like a church
bell rang out.</p>
<p>Corinna chuckled to herself and wiped tears of laughter from her
eyes. Charlotte shook her shoulders. "Cor, we need to go. Now."</p>
<p>The small vampire looked over her shoulder at her kindred, then at
the guards piling into the room. "Yes. I suppose it's that time."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many guards are there? (2d6)<br />
<strong>Roll:</strong> [7] A mob of 4d8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent jumped in front of the girls, putting himself between them
and the guards. He bared his fangs and claws. The guards unsheathed
their swords and pounced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 4d8: [4, 8, 8, 2] = 16 (d8)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8, Agility d6, Duty d10, Brawling
d10, Vampire 2d10: [4, 1, 2, 2, 5, 6] = 16 (d10) + Hitch; Spent 1 PP to
double Vampire and 1 PP to keep an extra die<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> The guard gives Vincent the "Wounded d6"
complication (stepped down).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent grabbed at the hilts of their swords to prevent their
attacks. With the flick of his wrist, he flipped one of the guards off
their feet and drove them into the wall with his shoulder. A third guard
gave him a shallow slash across his back while it was turned, but he
managed to spin and avoid the worst of it.</p>
<p>At the sight of Vincent being wounded, Charlotte leaped at the guards
like a rabid dog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlotte:</strong> Hopeless Romantic d8, Strength d6, Love
d10, Vampire 2d10: [8, 1, 9, 4, 1] = 17 (d10) + 2 Hitches; Spent 1 PP to
double Vampire<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 4d8: [1, 4, 5, 8] = 13 (d8) + Opportunity<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. Bought the hitches for 1
PP and started a "Vanessa is Coming" timed test with 5 beats. (Beats
will only decrease on PC actions.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte bowled over three of the guards, knocking them to the
ground. She stood on the chest of one of them and gripped onto their
skull. With a scream she ripped the guard's head clear off its
shoulders. Blood sprayed and covered the two prone guards.</p>
<p>One of the downed guards scrambled to his feet and fled the room in a
panic. He yelled for Vanessa at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>At the back of the room, Katherine had backed herself into a corner.
She was not a fighter and this was way too much for her. Even though she
attempted to make herself small, she had still managed to draw the
attention of a guard. They made a move to grab her. Margaret spotted
this from across the room and performed a hand motion that sent a wave
of energy toward the guard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 3d8: [2, 7, 3] = 10 (d8)<br />
<strong>Margaret:</strong> 2d8 + Blood Mage d10: [1, 5, 8] = 13 (d4) +
Hitch<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Margaret stops the guard. Bought the hitch for
1 PP to use an extra beat, leaving the countdown at 4 beats
remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret's spell caused the blood in the guard to heat. Their attack
was halted by the pain, but only momentarily.</p>
<p>Corinna watched this transpire and knew that she had to keep
Katherine alive. She was on the guard before anyone could see her move
from her position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Traitor d8, Strength d12, Power d10,
Celerity d10, Vampire d12: [8, 5, 10, 9, 3] = 19 (d12)<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 3d8: [1, 3, 8]= 11 (d4) + Opportunity<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. The heroic success keeps
the countdown at 4 beats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corinna sunk her claws into the guard's spine and with an effortless
motion she tore the guard's torso in two. Katherine, while safe, was
covered in gore and began shrieking. Corinna threw the two halves of the
guard against opposite walls and then took care to brush off her
dress.</p>
<p>In a panic, Katherine dashed past Corinna and beelined for the door.
She could barely see with the blood in her eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katherine's action uses a beat, leaving the countdown at 3.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Margaret stop her? (Yes/And, Straight,
Danger)<br />
<strong>Story:</strong> [5, 4, 3] She stops her without putting herself
in too bad of a position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Margaret reached out and hooked an arm around Katherine's waist as
she ran by. The mage then slammed Katherine into the wall. "Stay," she
commanded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vincent and Charlotte were locked in combat with the
remaining guards near the doorway. They had taken out a good number of
them already and they littered the floor.</p>
<p>The guard facing off against Charlotte swung frantically at her with
their sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8: [2, 5] = 7 (d4)<br />
<strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8, Agility d12, Duty d8,
Vampire d10: [6, 9, 7, 3] = 16 (d10)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> Charlotte dodges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte easily dodged the weapon and pushed the guard way with a
thrust of her arm. At the same time, another guard lunged at
Vincent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8 + Wounded d6 (Vincent): [4, 7, 2] = 11
(d6)<br />
<strong>Vincent:</strong> Warrior d8, Agility d6, Duty d10, Brawling
d10, Vampire d8: [1, 5, 5, 1, 8] = 13 (d10) + 2 Hitches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vincent caught the guard by the arm and used their own weight against
them, tossing them to the ground. Charlotte dashed after her attacker
and leapt at them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlotte:</strong> Vampire Princess d8, Strength d6, Power
d6, Vampire 2d10: [7, 5, 2, 9, 3] = 16 (d10); Spent 1 PP to double
Vampire<br />
<strong>Guards:</strong> 2d8: 12 (d4)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> 1 Guard is taken out. The countdown drops to 2
beats remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte knocked the guard off balance and pinned them to the
ground. Like a cobra strike she reached into the guard's chest and
yanked out their heart. They screamed before collapsing.</p>
<p>"This is taking too long," Corinna said from behind Vincent and
Charlotte. She calmly walked up to the prone guard and struck at them
with an axe kick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna:</strong> Cold d8, Strength d12, Power d10, Vampire
d12: [3, 5, 5, 6] = 11 (d12)<br />
<strong>Guard:</strong> d8: [8] = 8 (d4)<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> The last guard is taken out. The countdown
drops to 1 beat remaining but is stopped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heel of the small vampire sliced cleanly through the guard's neck
and cracked the floor below. Corinna retracted her foot and shook it,
grimacing at the gore that clung to it.</p>
<p>"We need to leave. Vanessa will be here any second," said
Margaret.</p>
<p>Charlotte put her hands on her hips. "What? You think that you're
joining us?"</p>
<p>"We can discuss this outside," Vincent said.</p>
<p>Corinna was already walking toward the door as she said "Agreed. I've
spent long enough in this place."</p>
