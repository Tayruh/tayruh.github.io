		<hr>
		<p>This story is set in the world of the web novel series <em>Worm</em> by Wildbow: <a target="_blank" href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com">https://parahumans.wordpress.com</a></p>
		<p>The following is a summary of characters and concepts found in this actual play that may be confusing to those have not read the series. I will try to avoid big spoilers. I also highly recommend reading the Worm series as it is one of my favorite works of fiction.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• For those that have read the story, this actual play begins at around chapter 12.1 of Worm, which is about 25% into the series, right after rescuing Charlotte from the Merchants.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<h2 id="a%20•%20b%20•%20c%20•%20d%20•%20e%20•%20f%20•%20g%20•%20i%20•%20l%20•%20m%20•%20p%20•%20r%20•%20s%20•%20t%20•%20u"><a href="#A">A</a> • <a href="#b">B</a> • <a href="#c">C</a> • <a href="#d">D</a> • <a href="#e">E</a> • <a href="#f">F</a> • <a href="#g">G</a> • <a href="#i">I</a> • <a href="#l">L</a> • <a href="#m">M</a> • <a href="#p">P</a> • <a href="#r">R</a> • <a href="#s">S</a> • <a href="#t">T</a> • <a href="#u">U</a></h2>
		<p><br> </p>
		<h2 id="a">A</h2>
		<h5 id="angelica">Angelica</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Angelica is one of Bitch's dogs—a terrier that she rescued. Angelica'a previous owner abused the dog and she is missing an eye and an ear. Fog injured Angelica in a fight against The Pure in such a way that doesn't heal when Bitch uses her power, and so she walks with a bit of a limp when now powered.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bitch originally had three dogs, and Angelica is the last one remaining. She is affectionate toward Skitter.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Angelica">[wiki]</a> </p>
		<h2 id="b">B</h2>
		<h5 id="bastard">Bastard</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• When Siberian attempted to pursuade Bitch to join the Slaughterhouse Nine, she gifted her a wolf pup, whom Bitch named Bastard.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bastard is the youngest of Bitch's dogs and least trained, but his wolf physiology seems to work with her power much better than domestic dogs. His transformation is smoother, faster, and more "complete". The bone spikes and large teeth of standard dog's monster form are askew and placed randomly, while Bastard's are symmetrical and natural looking.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Bastard">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="bitch%20(rachel)">Bitch (Rachel)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Rachel is the only member of the Undersiders with a known identity, having come into her powers in a very public way. She has chosen the name Bitch but the heroes refer to her as Hellhound to keep it PC.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bitch's power is that she can cause dogs to grow into huge monstrous hellhounds. The dogs in this form are the size of a small car, can carry two or three people on their backs, and can scale buildings by digging in their claws or triangle jumping. They are covered in bone spikes and can take bullet fire and lots of physical damage. In truth, the actual dog is normal size within the monstrous body and the hellhound exterior is like flesh armor.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Rachel isn't able to control her dogs with mental commands like Skitter does her bugs. Instead she spends her free time training them and issues commands with whistles and shouts.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Rachel has difficulty understanding human emotions and instead reads body language the way a dog would. This often leads to miscommunication, and so Rachel prefers to spend more time around dogs than people.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel_Lindt">[wiki]</a> </p>
		<h5 id="brockton%20bay">Brockton Bay</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Worm takes place in Brockton Bay, a fictional city located somewhere in New England of the United States, Earth Bet. This alternate world has superpowered beings (called parahumans, or the slang term "capes") like those in Marvel or DC comics, and like those comics, the parahumans tend to fall decisively on either the hero or villain side of the spectrum. The heroes have a team of defenders (like DC's Justice League) called the Protectorate, with a junior set (like DC's Teen Titans) called the Wards.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The city of Brockton Bay is currently recovering from the fallout of a large event; the aftermath of which allowed the Undersiders to divide and conquer the city. The city is now fully under the control of the villains and the heroes have been unable to interfere. It is at this point that the Slaughterhouse Nine has appeared in Brockton Bay, to add even more chaos to the disaster left behind by the event.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Brockton_Bay">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="c">C</h2>
		<h5 id="charlotte">Charlotte</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter's employee (she refuses to call them henchmen or minions) that helps manage her territory. She's a non-powered human that primarily liasons between Skitter and the civilians, as well as orders supplies for the territory. Charlotte used to attend high school with Taylor.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Charlotte">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="coil">Coil</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Coil is the backer behind the Undersiders. He funds their projects, including their providing them with bases in their territories and all of their supplies, as well as any mercenaries that they may need. All he requires is that they complete jobs for him when asked.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Coil is very enigmatic: no one knows his true name or intentions, though it's clear that he's working toward something. Only Tattletale knows his powers and she's under orders to never reveal them. He is also morally questionable, not even ashamed of having kidnapped and forced a drug addiction on a twelve year old so that he can keep her as a pet.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Coil">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="d">D</h2>
		<h5 id="dinah">Dinah</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• She is a young girl with the power to see multiple futures. Her power works best when someone asks a question, to which she can answer the probability of it happening within multiple decimal places. Using her power too much causes crippling migraines. Coil keeps her drugged with what she refers to as "candy" to keep her complacent and relieve the side-effects of her power.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Dinah_Alcott">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="e">E</h2>
		<h5 id="emma">Emma</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Emma was Taylor's best friend through childhood until she met Sophia. For whatever reason, the two of them began a two year bullying campaign against Taylor at school. The bullying escalated to the degree that Taylor had a breakdown and a short stint in a mental hospital. The bullying continued upon returning and Taylor eventually dropped out when the faculty wouldn't do anything about it.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Emma_Barnes">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="endbringers">Endbringers</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Endbringers are a group of superpowered beings, apparently inhuman, that are so strong that each time one attacks it's a world event. During an Endbringer attack, heroes and villains call a truce and work together to defeat the Endbringer at any cost. One to two hundred capes join the fight against a single Endbringer with an estimated 60% chance of survival.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• All Endbringers hold a peculiar physiology that contrasts typical biology. Rather than having a tougher exterior to protect their innards, their bodies actually get harder as it gets the closer to their core, with the external layers as dense as aluminum alloy and their core as dense as boron.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• There are six Endbringers: Behemoth, Leviathan, The Simurgh, Khonso, Tohu, and Bohu. Fortunately they only attack one at a time (with the exception of Tohu and Bohu who work as a team) and wait months between attacks.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Endbringers">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="f">F</h2>
		<h5 id="fenrir's%20chosen">Fenrir's Chosen</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Like The Pure, the Chosen was formed when Empire-Eighty Eight went under. While The Pure can be considered a somewhat tolerable group of villains containing members with racist tendencies, the Chosen revel in their hatemongering. Their group consists of the kinds of people that would beat someone to death in the street simply because of their skin color or sexual preference. Also in contrast with the Pure, which contains only a handful of members, the Chosen is a large gang of humans being lead by a few parahumans, set up in a militaristic ranks.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Chosen are Hookwolf, Menja, Cricket, Stormtiger, Othala, Rune, and Victor.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Fenrir's_Chosen">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="g">G</h2>
		<h5 id="grue%20(brian)">Grue (Brian)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Grue is the psuedo leader of the Undersiders. The team is more of a democracy, but when shots need to be called, everyone looks to Grue—possibly because of age, and possibly because of intimidating appearance. Brian is tall and muscular, his body built through rigorous exercise and training in multiple martial arts.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Brian has a protective feelings toward Taylor whose hero tendancies constantly cause her to suicidally put herself in harm's way for the sake of others. Brian has difficulty controlling Rachel since she only understands body language and not emotions, which usually results in him having to assert his dominance through posturing or violence.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Grue's power is that he can create a cloud of darkness. When in that cloud you're unable to see or hear, and your sense of touch and powers are dulled. It can also absorb radiation and heat. Grue can see through his own darkness like it's not there. While you can't hear yourself speak in his darkness, he can hear you perfectly.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Brian_Laborn">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="i">I</h2>
		<h5 id="imp%20(aisha)">Imp (Aisha)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Aisha is Grue's younger sister. Grue chose to work for Coil because he was promised that Coil's connections would allow him to gain guardianship over her and take her away from her drug addicted mother and her abusive boyfriends.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Imp's power is memory alteration. Her power, which is always running, constantly makes you forget that she exists, effectively granting her a form of invisibility. Imp has to concentrate to disable her power, and when she does, all of the memories associated with her return, excepting those that happened while her power was enabled. Her power doesn't always work against capes that also have mental powers, and is completely ineffective against electronics.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Aisha_Laborn">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="l">L</h2>
		<h5 id="leviathan">Leviathan</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Leviathan is one of the Endbringers. His power is water manipulation. Whenever Leviathan moves a body part, he leaves an after-echo of water, causing water to appear out of nowhere to fill the space that his body held. He can also control water on a macro scale, pulling entire cities into the ocean. He nearly did this to Brockton Bay when he created a lake by pulling the center of the city below the water table.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Leviathan">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="m">M</h2>
		<h5 id="mannequin">Mannequin</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• A member of the Slaughterhouse Nine. His power revolves around developing technology for sealed systems that exists far beyond the current level of modern day technology. He has used this ability to replace all of his own body parts with that technology, sealing his organs inside metal vacuum sealed units. This somehow allows his body to be modular, with the ability to disconnect and reconnect his arms or even his head at will. His forearms are attached by cables, and he can fiire them like a cannon and then reel back in. A telescoping blade can extend from the center of his palms. He can also release a flammable poisonous gas from his mouth.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Mannequin never speaks and instead communicates through body language and other means. He also prefers to target tinkers like himself (ie. capes whose powers focus on creating tech) and capes who focus on helping the community. The latter is why Skitter is frequently in his crosshairs.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Mannequin">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20merchants">The Merchants</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Merchants were a gang racists, thugs, rednecks, and generally nasty and disgusting people that were all about drugs, guns, raping, fighting, and basically being horrible human beings. The Merchant gang members were not parahumans but the gang leaders were.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter found a classmate of hers, Charlotte, being forced to dance during a Merchant rally and rescued her. The following day, the Slaughterhouse Nine wiped the Merchants off the face of the planet. Nothing of value was lost.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Archer's_Bridge_Merchants">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="p">P</h2>
		<h5 id="the%20pure">The Pure</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• When the superpowered hate group Empire Eighty-Eight dissolved after the death of its leader, Kaiser, it reformed into two groups: The Pure and The Chosen. Of the two, The Pure is not quite as racist and packs a lot more power. It is lead by Purity, the ex-wife of Kaiser.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Pure are Purity, Crusader, Night, and Fog.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pure">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="purity">Purity</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Purity was a nice young woman who got wrapped up in Kaiser's charm, and then years later found herself trapped in a toxic marriage by a gaslighter who managed to covert her to racism. She left him and considers herself a good person and fights against her learned racist perspectives, but still surrounds herself with "friends" who are racists and nazis.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Purity gets her power by storing light in her body. She then can expel that light so bright that it's difficult to look at her. She can also fly and shoot destructive beams of light capable of leveling a building.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Purity">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="r">R</h2>
		<h5 id="regent%20(alec)">Regent (Alec)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent is a young member of the Undersiders who also happens to be a sociopath. He acts like he cares, because it's what he's supposed to do, but he probably wouldn't actually care if all of his teammates died, with the possible exception of Imp.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent's power is that he can control nervous system impulses of his target. This manifests in two ways: the quickest and minimal use causes his target to misfire (stumbling, dropping something, pulling a trigger, etc), and the long term use allows him to completely take over the target's nervous system and control them like a puppet. When controlling a puppet he has access to their senses, speech, and muscle memory.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Regent also likes to carry around a scepter to match his regal costume. The scepter has a stun taser hidden in its crown.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Jean-Paul_%22Alec%22_Vasil">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="s">S</h2>
		<h5 id="shadow%20stalker%20(sophia)">Shadow Stalker (Sophia)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Shadow Stalker's power is that she can turn into mist that is as light as air and can travel through solid objects. Electricity appears to be deadly to her when in this state though. Her favored weapon is a crossbow. When she joined the Wards they made her use tranquilizer darts, but she'd switch to steel stipped arrows whenever they weren't looking.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• At her core, Shadow Stalker is not a very good person. She is a vigilante that was forced to be on a hero team due to a court order because the alternative was jail. When out of costume, Sophia went to the same school as Taylor and, with the help of Taylor's ex-bestfriend Emma, has bullied Taylor for years and made her life absolute hell.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Through an unexpected event, Taylor discovered that Shadow Stalker was Sophia, and wasn't all that heartbroken to have her teammate Regent possess Shadow Stalker's body in the attempt to infiltrate the Ward HQ. At the end of this, Regent took things a bit further by ruining Sophia's home life and then revealing her illegal use of arrows, which violated her parole.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Stalker">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20siberian">The Siberian</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Siberian is one of the most dangerous supervillains in existence. Her power is that she is both an immovable object and an unstoppable force. In essence she gets to choose how the laws of physics affect her, which makes her immune to harm and the effects of powers, and able to explode building walls like confetti as she leisurely walks through them. She can extend this power to anything or anyone she touches. Since her power alters the effect of inertia and air resistance, she can use this to leap city blocks and run faster than your average automobile.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• For whatever reason, Siberian is always nude. Her skin consists of alternating white and black stripes. Siberian never talks.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/The_Siberian">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="skitter%20(taylor)">Skitter (Taylor)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter/Taylor is the main character of the story. She is a high school girl with the ability to control bugs with her mind. While seemingly an ineffective power, it becomes devastating when used on the scale at which she can operate.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter can control all bugs within a 5 block radius with no upper limit to the amount that she can control, easily able to control millions with no effort. She has an unparalleled multitasking ability that allows her to send unique commands to each individual bug, as well as receive sensory input and the exact location of every bug in relation to herself. The latter allows her relative omniscience within the radius of her power.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Favored tricks of hers are to form swarms of her bugs into decoys that look exactly like her (covering herself in bugs to look like them as well), modulate the pitch of the swarm's buzzing to form spoken words, position her bugs to form words in the sky, form large nets spun by thousands of spiders, and lace the stingers of her insects with capsaicin to greatly increase their effectiveness.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter's outfit is made from spider-silk and insect carapaces, making it highly resistance to piercing attacks. Taylor believes in always being prepared, and so she carries a telescoping police baton, a military-grade combat knife, a can of pepper spray, a hand gun, and various other useful items tucked in pockets of her outfit.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Taylor originally wanted to be a hero, and in fact joined the Undersiders with the intent to gather intel on them and then sell them out to the Protectorate, in the hopes that it would gain her cred so that they'd put her on a team. But then she learned that heroes can be every bit as bad as villains, and so she decided to stay with the Undersiders. This idea was reinforced when she learned that the only way to free Dinah from Coil was to bargain her away from him by making herself a valuable tool.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Taylor_Hebert">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="slaughterhouse%20nine">Slaughterhouse Nine</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Slaughterhouse Nine is a ragtag collection of nightmare fuel villains that heroes and villains alike fear like boogeymen. The Nine travels the country with the sole purpose of creating chaos and fear wherever they go. The team is normally composed of nine members, but when their membership drops due to death, they go recruiting. The Nine is currently down a member and is recruiting.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Slaughterhouse Nine are Jack Slash, Mannequin, Bonesaw, Shatterbird, Burnscar, The Siberian, Crawler, and Cherish.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterhouse_Nine">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="t">T</h2>
		<h5 id="tattletale%20(lisa)">Tattletale (Lisa)</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Tattletale invited Skitter to join the Undersiders and they quickly became best friends. No one has been as unwaveringly supportive of Taylor as Lisa, even in the light of her attempt to sell out the group to the heroes. Lisa is very snarky and her mouth frequently gets her in trouble.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Tattletale's power is that she has a voice in her head that constantly analyzes everything she sees and hears, extrapolates ridiculous levels of information from the details, and draws connections to form unbelievable and accurate conclusions—such as being able to determine someone's numeric pin based on their casual clothes or know the layout of an entire office building from a photo of the lobby. Information is power though, so she keeps the nature of her power a secret by spreading the rumor that she is a telepath.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Since Lisa's power is not combat centric, she carries a gun with her whenever she goes out.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Wilbourn">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h5 id="the%20travelers">The Travelers</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Travelers are another group working under Coil in addition to the Undersiders. Not much is known about them other than the fact that they move from city to city, working under each of the resident crime lords for a time before moving on to the next location. They appear to be looking for the solution to an ongoing problem, and Coil is offering them a potential answer. Like the Undersiders, Coil has assigned each of the members of the Travelers their own piece of Brockton Bay to control.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Travelers are Trickster, Sundancer, Genesis, Ballistic, Oliver, and Noelle.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• <a target="_blank" href="https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/The_Travelers">[wiki]</a></p>
		<h2 id="u">U</h2>
		<h5 id="the%20undersiders">The Undersiders</h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;• The Undersiders started as a relatively harmless group of villains that only did small jobs and whose only claim to fame was that they could never be caught. Once Skitter joined, her high degree of tactical ability allowed them to execute higher profile jobs, making complete fools out of both the Wards and even the Protectorate. And then taking advantage of a horrible situation with the assistance of their backer, Coil, they took out their competition and claimed the entire city. While the Undersiders may be lawbreaking, they are not very villainous as far as villains go, and in fact risk their lives to protect civilians in the territories that they have claimed.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• The Undersiders are Skitter, Tattletale, Grue, Regent, Bitch, and Imp.<br>
