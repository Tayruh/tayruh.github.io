		<h2 id="chapter%201">Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Detective Enkidu clutched her umbrella, shielding herself from the rain. The drops hit hard on the concrete slabs leading up to the Royal Plaza Hotel. Puddles sparkled with the alternating red and blue light emanating from the police cruisers. Media vans were parked a short distance from the scene. Their star reporters leaned as far as they could over the police tape that cordoned off the public, trying to catch whatever glimpse that they could.</p>
		<p>Enkidu squeezed through the crowd of civilians and ducked under the yellow tape as she made her way toward the focus of their attention—a tarp covering the body. The rain hit against the tarp with a grating pitter-patter noise. The ground crunched as Enkidu came to a stop before a man crouched by the tarp. </p>
		<p>"Took your time," he said. The man was covered from head to toe in rain-proof forensics gear that hid his face, but Enkidu was familiar with that voice. Detective Johnny Nicholson. Not her favorite person, but he did his job well, which was more than she could say for the rest of her precinct.</p>
		<p>Enkidu ignored his remark and asked what he found. Nicholson pulled back the tarp just enough to show the corpse's face without exposing the evidence to the rain. "Deceased. White female. Looks to be in her mid-twenties. Time of death around 2:30am. Current evidence points to death by fall." He pointed up to give credence to his assessment.</p>
		<p>Enkidu followed his finger. Sure enough, the glass canopy above the hotel's entrance was shattered. Her gaze climbed the building, and landed on the blinding red sign of the hotel forty stories later.</p>
		<p>She asked Nicholson of he thought it was a a suicide and he reminded Enkidu that detecting was her job, not his. She dismissed his response with a wave of her hand.</p>
		<p>Enkidu shifted her attention to the crowd of onlookers. She could tell at a glance that the majority of the civilians were there in macabre fascination, but a few among them were clearly distraught. Those would be her witnesses. The detective grimaced as she recognized the two beat officers managing the crowd.</p>
		<p>Enkidu holds up her badge. "Boys."</p>
		<!--
		Rewrite from here down.
		-->
		<p>They nodded at her disapprovingly. She asked what they knew. They told her that the woman fell, which was obvious and she knew already. They were adamant that this was a suicide and that she was just wasting her time.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction / corruption everywhere) [8] + 2 = 10. Take 2 clues with <em>question//beat cops</em> method and source. Mark attention on <em>Precinct 23</em> theme.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What is the situation on the roof? (1) No signs of a struggle.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked them what the situation on the roof was. According to them, it was all clean and there were no signs of a struggle.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did they notice anything out of the ordinary? (0) They point out the sequins.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She asked if they noticed anything unusual and one of them mentioned seeing golden sequins all over the building, then pointed out some near the body. She thanked them for their time and inspected the sequins. As she peered at them, it felt like they're shifting in and out of reality.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Look Beyond the Mist:</strong> (+1 mythos) [6] + 1 = 7. Take 1 clue with <em>examine//sequins</em> method and source. Answer is unreliable.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What are they really? (0) Parts of a clock?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She couldn't focus on them clearly but an image of clockwork gears overlayed the sequins, giving her a sense of double vision. She directed Nicholson to tag the sequins as evidence. She made a mental note to herself to examine the woman beyond the physical when she visited the morgue later.</p>
		<p>Enkidu asked the officers for a list of witnesses and they pointed out a woman and a man from the crowd. Enkidu greeted the woman and asked her name. She was Macy Kraus.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction) [12] + 3 = 15. Take 3 clues with  <em>question//Macy</em> method and source.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What did she see? (2) She saw the woman fall about 30 minutes ago.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked what she saw, and the woman said that she saw the deceased fall about half an hour ago, which lined up with Nicholson's time of death.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did she see anyone else on the roof? (1) No, and the woman didn't scream either.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The detective asked if she had seen anyone on the roof with her at that time, and Macy said that she had spotted the woman standing on the edge of the roof and then she walked right off. She didn't see anyone push her and she didn't scream on the way down—all of which added weight to suicide theory.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What was the woman doing when she witnessed the fall? (0) [Defiant / Break] She was smoking.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked Macy where she was when she saw the woman fall, and she said that she was outside smoking. She wasn't allowed to smoke in the casino, so she had to come out here. </p>
		<p>Next she interviewed the man who introduced himself as Raymond Frank.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction) [7] + 3 = 10. Take 3 clues with <em>question//Raymond</em> method and source.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What did he see? (2) He noticed her in the casino tonight.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked what the man saw. He said that he wasn't around for the fall, but he noticed her in the casino earlier that night.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Was she with anyone? (1) She was alone.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She asked if the woman was all alone and Raymond said that she was, and that he regretted not making a move now.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did he notice anything else that was unusual? (0) [Mundane / Dirty] Nothing unusual except the sequins.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She asked if he found anything else strange tonight. The man said that the place had gold sequins everywhere, like remnants of party decorations, which was odd because there wasn't a special event that went on that night or the previous night and the place was usually very clean.</p>
		<p>Finished with her questions, Enkidu made her way into the hotel. From the entrance she could see the reception straight ahead and the lobby and bar off to the side. Both areas were full of guests making demands of the staff.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she question the reception? (50/50) Otherwise she checks out the lobby. [20] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
