		</blockquote>
		<hr>
		<h1 id="scene%201">Scene 1</h1>
		<p>Charlotte bursts in through the door to my base and slams it shut behind her. Seconds later, blades stab through the door from the opposite side. Charlotte screams that it's Mannequin and disappears into the kitchen to hide. I ready my baton and knife.</p>
		<p>The hinges to the door are sheared off and the door collapses to the ground. Mannequin steps inside. I immediately gather a swarm.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Change the Game:</strong> (mass of bugs, create a distraction) [4, 2] + 2 = 8. Take <em>summoned swarm</em> and <em>web net</em> tags.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I gather a swarm and they begin spinning web nets. Mannequin lunges at me with his blades extended.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Go Toe to Toe:</strong> (swarm sense, perfect spatial sense, predict a foe’s next move) [2, 1] + 3 = 6. Miss.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (push myself) [2, 4] + 1 = 7. Reduce tier by 1. Take <em>bruised-ribs-1</em> status. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I only just barely manage to roll out of the way, but not before he stabs me with his blade. Thankfully the suit prevents the blade from puncturing me. However it doesn't stop it from stabbing me in the ribs. I cry out in pain and quickly scamper away.</p>
		<p>Not letting up, he fires his arm at me like a cannon.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Go Toe to Toe:</strong> (swarm sense, perfect spatial sense, predict a foe’s next move, knife and baton / bruised-ribs-1) [3, 1]  + 3 = 7. Take cover.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Thanks to the fly resting on his knuckles, I was able to perfectly predict the trajectory of his outstretched hand and deflect it with my baton. It veers off course and slams into the wall to the side of me. Before he can react, I sic my bugs on him. Moths carrying spiders drop web nets across his frame.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Change the Game:</strong> (stingers and webs, summoned swarm, web net) [2, 4] + 3 = 9. Give <em>webbed-3</em> status to Mannequin, applying to player moves. Remove <em>summoned swarm</em> and <em>web net</em> tags.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The webs cover his body and he strains against them. I don't have a lot of avenues available to me in the way of damaging him, but I decide to see if dismantling is possible while he's somewhat restrained. I dash around his back and slam my knife into the crook of his neck, attempting to pry his head off.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Hit With All You've Got:</strong> (knife and baton, ruthless punishment, webbed-3 / bruised-ribs-1) [5, 5] + 4 = 14. Increase tier by 1 and take cover. Give <em>headless-3</em> status (reduced by 2) to Mannequin on <em>hurt or subdue</em> spectrum. Burn <em>ruthless punishment</em> crew tag.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I manage to pry his head from his shoulders. Unsurprisingly, he seems just fine. So fine in fact that he attacks me with the same arm from before, since it was extended beyond the webbing.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Go Toe to Toe:</strong> (swarm sense, perfect spatial sense, predict a foe’s next move / bruised-rib-1) [1, 2] + 2 = 5. Miss.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (push myself / bruised-ribs-1) [2, 5] + 0 = 7. Reduce tier by 1. Take <em>grabbed-2</em> status.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The arm swings toward my face and I dodge at exactly the last second by flopping onto my back. Mannequin changes the course of his arm and grabs toward my ankle instead.</p>
		<p>I try to scamper away but Mannequin is too quick and he grabs me by the ankle. He hoists me off the ground and I dangle there, helpless. Although, he isn't really able to do much himself either, being webbed as he is. However, he <em>is</em> capable of smashing my skull into the floor, which I'm deathly afraid of. Using that fear as fuel, I slam away at his claw using his own head, trying to free myself.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Go Toe to Toe:</strong> (push myself / grabbed-2) [3, 5] - 1 = 7. Achieve goal. Remove the <em>grabbed-2</em> status. <br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (bruised-ribs-1) [1, 5] - 1 = 5. Miss.  Take bad-fall-2 status, which stacks with bruised-ribs-1 as <em>injured-side-2</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I smash his claw repeatedly with all my might. It releases me and I fall to the floor flat on my back. I let out a loud groan and resist the urge to curl into a fetal position from the pain. Instead, I force myself to roll away.</p>
		<p>Mannequin pulls at the webbing with his damaged claw, which is apparently still operational enough for an escape attempt. Honestly, I'm not thrilled at having him as a permanent fixture of my lair either, so he'll have to leave at some point. However, I'm also not ready to have more blades being swung at my face, so I figure I should take advantage while he's still bound.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Hit With All You've Got:</strong> (knife and baton, push myself, webbed-3 / injured-side-2) [6, 2] + 3 = 11. Increase tier by 1 and take cover. Give heavily-gouged-3 status (reduced by 2) to Mannequin on <em>hurt or subdue</em> spectrum, which stacks with headless-3 as <em>damaged-4</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I jam my knife into the hole where his head should be. I wasn't expecting to injure him, and this act feels more petty than anything, but I create large gouges along the inside of his neck hole. Mannequin doesn't seem to like this at all and struggles even more against the webbing.</p>
		<p>Mannequin resists the webbing and basically throws himself at me in anger, though the webbing is still limiting his mobility.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Reduce webbed-3 status on Mannequin to <em>hindered-2</em>.</p>
		  <p><strong>Go Toe to Toe:</strong> (swarm sense, perfect spatial sense,  predict a foe’s next move, hindered-2 / injured-side-2) [1, 2] + 3 = 6. Miss.<br>
		  <strong>Face Danger:</strong> (push myself, hindered-2 / injured-side-2) [2, 2] + 1 = 5. Miss. Take battered-2 status, which stacks with injured-side-2 as <em>really-hurting-3</em>.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Mannequin hits me like a ton of bricks and sends skidding across the floor from his body check. I come to a stop by slamming into the wall on the opposite side of the room.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Change the Game:</strong> (mass of bugs, create a distraction) [2, 6] + 2 = 10. Take <em>swarm barrier</em> tag and make it ongoing.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I desperately need to keep the distance between us while I recover, so I create a wall of flying insects. I keep the cloud as cover while I push myself to my feet, using the wall as support. Keeping my back to the wall and the swarm blocking his vision of me, I slide along the perimeter of the room in an attempt to make an exit.</p>
