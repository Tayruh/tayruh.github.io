# Story

## Setup

> The sleepy town of Darkness Falls hides demons. 
> 
> **Motif:** A dead man’s daughter, attacked by a fiend a year to a day after his death.  
> **Motif:** A witch, surrounded by ritual and sacrifice, claiming innocence.  
> **Ominous place:** A small town in a big forest, haunted, where time doesn’t flow as it should.

## Act 1

### Scene 1
> **Framing:** flashback, preparation, negotiation  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[The Dweller in the Waters. A woman-octopus, singing idly as she waits.] A woman with a lot of secrets and a mysterious purpose. Perhaps the witch mentioned in the initial motif?
> 
> Show a flashback of you interrogating the town witch even though you don't believe in magic.
> 
> **Q:** Is the witch young?  
> **Oracle:** \[2, 5] Yes, but she says it's only because of a spell.
> 
> **Q:** Is she attracted to me?  
> **Oracle:** \[6, 6] (ignore flaw) Yes.

A few months ago I found myself in the cabin of a young woman names Seraphine. She was an attractive red-head with a fair complexion. I had come to her residence to ask her a few questions and she graciously let me in. 

> **Q:** What am I asking about?  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[Fertility. Purposeful Growth (Wantonness). A casual proposition hides a dark motive.] She had some sort of connection with the daughter. Relationship?

I asked her about her relation to the young woman in question, Abigail, as there had been rumors around town about the two being close.

> **Q:** Does she confirm?  
> **Oracle:** \[2, 5] Yes, but..  
> **Dramatic Move:** (Act 1) someone feels something  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[Satyr. Tolerance (Enthusiasm). People don't always know when they are happy.] They cut their fling short because one of them took the situation for granted.
> 
> **Q:** Was the witch the one to cut it off?  
> **Oracle:** \[6, 6] (flawed) She did, but she's been trying to get back together but the girl refuses.

She explained--in perhaps unnecessary detail--the couple's relationship. It was mostly a fling; social gatherings and booty calls. Seraphine had grown tired of the arrangement and cut it off, but then had second thoughts weeks later. She explained that Abigail had grown distant, however. She was preoccupied with something and refused to take visitors--not even her ex-lover.

I asked if she had any idea what could be bothering Abigail. She was quick to deny it, but it felt like she knew more and so I pushed.

> **Goal:** Convince her to tell me what she knows.  
> **Danger:** Seraphine will get angry for not believing her.  
> **Strive:** (charm, persuade) \[6, 4 + 2] (clock) Strong Hit: Gain the light die *Seraphine is willing to help*  
> **Story Motif:** \[An unwelcome inheritance, dreams of a stranger, a clue in the earth.] My family has a history with demons?  
> **Dramatic Move:** Turn someone’s action back on them.  
> **Clock:** 5

"She was scared. It looked like she hadn't slept in days. She kept whispering to herself about demons," Seraphine said. She studied my face and then she smirked as she asked, "What do you know of demons? I've heard tales of your family."

"More than I'd like, but nothing that I believe," I said. I returned to the line of questioning, "Do you know where Abigail may have gone?"

> **Q:** Does she have any idea?  
> **Oracle:** \[5, 5] (flawed) She may not have left.

"Are you sure she's actually gone?" she asked in return.

"What do you mean?"

"There are different planes of reality layered upon one another. They exist in the same physical space, but shifted. Demons are said to exist on planes like these. Since she was raving about demons, perhaps she is still at home but on another plane." Seraphine said this ridiculous statement without a hint of amusement. 

I was at a loss on how to respond. When I did not, she continued, "I have some free time if you would like me to accompany you."

After a moment of consideration, I agreed. Even if she was off her rocker, she may still bring extra insight into the case.

> Add the story motif *A promiscuous witch, a little too happy to help, but full of secrets.*

<br>

> **Framing:** aftermath, investigation, interrupt  
> **Story Motif:** \[A small-time psychic, offering details of a crime only the killer could know.] Does Seraphine know more than she is letting on?

We arrived at Abigail's house together. I knocked, but of course there was no answer. Abigail lived alone now that her father had passed. 

Her father's death was a burden on me. A case that I failed to solve in time that resulted in the young girl losing her only parental figure. A feeling of obligation lead to me checking in with her occasionally. It was this last visit in which I had learned that she hadn't been seen for days.

After confirming that the street was empty, I pulled out my lockpick. It took only a few moments and then the door was unlocked and we were safely inside.

Seraphine mentioned that I seemed to be quite familiar with the door's lock, and I explained how I had let myself in yesterday when she didn't answer the door.

"Don't you think that's overly intrusive?" she asked.

"I worry about her. I wanted to make sure she wasn't hurt or dead."

"That's sweet. For the most part," Seraphine said.

> I've decided to give myself the rank-2 trauma *Overprotective* as it fits my view of the character.
> 
> **Catalyst:** something vital is missing  
> **Dark Motif:** \[what dreams may come] Something related to Abigail's future plans is missing?  
> **Q:** What is missing?  
> **Minor Motif:** \[harmony and satisfaction] Perhaps she wanted to be a musician. Maybe her violin is missing.
> 
> **Q:** How does the house look?  
> **Minor Motif:** \[small attachment; minor bond] She kept it the same as when her father lived there.

The two of us searched the small house for any signs of a struggle, or a note, or--god help me--a portal into another dimension. We came up empty. 

The house seemed unchanged since I last saw it, which in turn was unchanged since the last time I saw her father. The poor girl refused to put away any items of his and still kept his jacket by the door and his coffee mug on the counter.

"That is strange," Seraphine said, breaking the silence of the search. "Where is her violin?"

"Violin?"

"Yes. You weren't aware? Abigail was a proficient violinist. Her dream was to leave this small town and join an orchestra. Sadly, no one ever leaves this town."

"Perhaps she did. We should check the train station to see if she purchased a ticket."

<br>

> **Framing:** transition, negotiation, flashback  
> **General Motif:** \[ROSE: A cruel enchantment, robbing a warrior of her skills, forcing adaptation.] I'm failing at my detective work, so I need to change my approach.  
> **Catalyst:** someone gets into a fight  
> **Q:** Who gets into a fight?  
> **People Motif:** \[Those Who Are: The Life-Tree. Adorned with eyes; the bitterest wisdom imparted is that some prices are too high to pay.] Someone wants me to stop looking for Abigail.

We arrived at the train station around noon. It was vacant, as it always was every time I came to this town. There was only one person in the entire place and that was the ticket holder.

> **Q:** What is the ticket holder like?  
> **People Motif:** \[Those Who Guide: The Twin Ravens. Memory and Thought, inextricably linked, shaping reality around them.] An older, intelligent man.

I approached the man in the booth. "Excuse me, but I'm looking for a young girl. I was hoping you could tell me whether you've seen her."

The man looked up from the newspaper that he was reading. "A lot of young women come through here. I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific."

"Well, we both know that's not true. No one comes through here. If you saw her, you'd remember."

The man eyed me from behind the glass. "Then I didn't see anyone."

"He's being awfully cagey," Seraphine said.

"I agree." I edged up closer to the glass. "What aren't you telling me?"

He raised his newspaper and pretended to read. "I'm afraid I don't know anything. But perhaps Samuel has seen your missing girl."

From around the booth came a large man. He looked not unlike a mafia strongman, and appeared to share a similar purpose. The man stalked towards me and reached out for my collar.

> **Goal:** I attempt to dodge.  
> **Danger:** He grapples me.  
> **Strive:** (light die: Seraphine's help) \[6,5] (clock) Strong Hit: Gain the light die *Seraphine has my back*  
> **Story Motif:** \[a promiscuous witch, a little too happy to help, but full of secrets; what does she really want from me?] Seraphine, obviously.  
> **Dramatic Move:** \[Use someone’s character aspects against them.] Rumors about her being a witch.  
> **Clock:** 4

The strong man grabbed me by the collar and lifted me from the ground. I was at a severe disadvantage with my feet dangling inches above solid footing. Just then the man let out a yelp and crumpled to the ground, releasing me in the process. Seraphine stood above us and looked angrily down at the man.

The man held his nether regions and groaned in pain. When he finally looked up to see his assailant, he looked shocked. "Wait. I know you. You're that witch."

"What do you know about me?" Seraphine peered down at him with her hands on her hips.

"The whole town knows about you. You're the witch that lives in the woods. They say you lead children to your cottage and eat them like in that fairytale... Hans and Greta."

"Hansel and Gretel. Simpleton," she says. "And no, I do not."

The man scuttled away from her. "Whatever you say. Just don't kill me, alright?"

She stalked towards him. "Okay, then. Where is Abigail?" 

> **Q:** Does he tell her anything?  
> **Oracle:** \[5,2+1] Yes, but..  
> **Dramatic Move:** Reveal an unwelcome truth.  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[AIR: skill, strategy, society • intellect; Spring. Newness (Decay). Rejoice in the ephemeral, before it is gone.] He doesn't know the current whereabouts.

He held up his hands. "I don't know. I delivered her to the boss and that's the last I saw of her. I have no idea where she is now."

"And where can we find this boss of yours?" I asked him.

> **Q:** Where would they be?  
> **Minor Motif:** \[hard work, arrest of decay] A funeral home.

He looked up at me like he only just remembered that I was there. "She owns the funeral home in town. Alice."

Seraphine gave me a quizzical look but I was just as surprised. What was going on?

<br>

### Scene 2

> **Framing:** pay-off or choice, introduction, escape/pursuit  
> **Lock-in Goal:** save themselves from a threat  
> **Dramatic Move:** Reveal an unwelcome truth.

It was a small town; the funeral home was easy to find, even without Seraphine guiding the way. We entered the front door and found ourselves in a spacious yet cozy parlor. An elegant woman in a blue dress stood in the center of the room. She turned towards us at the sound of the door chime.

"Welcome," she said. "How may I help you?"

I removed my hat and gave a light bow. "Good morning, ma'am. Would you be Alice?"

She blinked. "Yes? May I know who is asking?"

"My name is Jack. I am a detective. This is my companion, Seraphine. We are looking into the disappearance of a young woman named Abigail. Have you seen her?"

Alice smiled politely. It was a fake smile. "Unless she is dead, I haven't seen her. Why would you inquire here, of all places?"

"I have reason to believe that you've been in contact with her," I said.

> **Q:** Does she answer me?  
> **Oracle:** \[4,5] (clock) Yes, but..  
> **Dramatic Move:** (oracle) \[Reveal an unwelcome truth.] Abigail is dead.  
> **Dramatic Move:** (clock) Offer a hard bargain or an ugly choice.  
> **Q:** What are the choices?  
> **Minor Motif:** \[distressed; in need of assistance] Seraphine is in danger.  
> **Minor Motif:** \[strength through what is seized] Lose Abigail.  
> **Clock:** 3

She continued to smile. "Like I said, unless she is dead, I haven't seen her. You are in luck, however, as she is indeed dead." She turned to her side and looked toward the room connecting to the parlor. "Isn't that right, Abigail?"

A scuffing sound came from the side; the sound of a foot being dragged as they walked. Neither Seraphine nor I wanted to look. We did not want to believe that Abigail was dead. Further more, we did not want to believe that she became a monstrosity. However, we did not have to turn, because soon Abigail stood before us.

Our friend looked like death. Her hair was ragged and hung in front of her face. Her clothes were disheveled. Her fingernails were chipped and torn and bloody, like she had been digging at the walls. Her head hung low, as though it were too heavy to been supported by her neck. She let out raspy breathes that fell somewhere between wheezing and panting.

"Abigail...?" Seraphine asked tentatively.

The ragged girl peered at Seraphine through gap in her dirty locks of hair. She just wheezed and said nothing.

"Seraphine, stay back. I don't trust her," I said.

"But... it's my Abigail." 

Seraphine took a step toward her friend. Alice crossed her arms and rested her chin in the palm of her hand as she observed. Her face lit up with amusement at the events unfolding before her.

Abigail immediately lunged at Seraphine. The woman barely had time to react and managed to hold her friend at arms length. Abigail snapped her jaws at Seraphine. I raised my gun at Abigail and shouted for her to step away but my demands fell on deaf ears. Alice laughed hysterically. 

I swore and pulled the trigger. Abigail stumbled back just long enough for Seraphine to break free. She ran to me and practically hid behind my back. I kept my gun trained on Abigail and Alice. Alice continued to laugh. 

Abigail regained her composure and started after us. I was somehow relieved that she appeared to be okay, despite the fact that I had given her a gut wound. However, she was clearly still a threat that we couldn't handle at the moment, and so I made a strategic retreat with Seraphine. Abigail gave chase.

> **Goal:** Outrun Abigail.  
> **Danger:** Abigail catches them.  
> **Strive:** (clever, distract, light die: Seraphine has my back) \[6,2+2] Strong Hit: Gain the light die *distraction*  
> **Q:** How should I distract her?  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[FIRE: body, action, transform • vigor; Sword. Strike (Parry). A double-edged sword, not yet bloody.] Scare her with fire.

Seraphine and I bolted for the exit but Abigail was hot on our heels. For a zombie, she was incredibly quick. We made it to the door, but before we could open it, Abigail was upon us.

The girl once again attacked Seraphine. It was all she could do to fight off. I tried pulling Abigail off of her but she was incredibly strong and resisted. Not sure what else to do, I lit my lighter and waved it in her face. Abigail reared back and batted at the flame, but it gave Seraphine enough time to escape out the door.

Unlucky for me, however, Abigail was positioned between me and the door. Having lost her prey, she gave me her undivided attention. I waved the flame back and forth in front of her face, attempting to stave her off. She growled and swatted at it like a kitten. I was unsure whether she was scared of the flame or wanted to play with it.

Not seeing a better option, I tossed the lighter to the side in the hopes that she was in fact enamored by it.

> **Q:** Does Abigail go for the flame?  
> **Oracle:** \[4, 5] Yes, but... it's super effective.

Where the lighter landed wasn't at the forefront of my mind at the time, but in hindsight I should have perhaps taken care with my aim. The lighter landed directly at the foot of the window drapes and they  immediately went up in flames. I could hear Alice yell in anger behind me, but I couldn't care less. All that mattered in the moment was that I was right--Abigail was enthralled by the flames. She watched with dazzled eyes as the flames traveled up the drapes and along the ceiling. 

With her distracted, I escaped the building. Seraphine there was waiting nervously for me outside. I grabbed her hand and we ran.

> Lost the light die *distracted*
> 
> Added the story motif *The one I swore to protect, now undead, taken from me.*
> 
> Added the story motif *The master of the dead, the unhinged woman in blue, the one controlling it all.*

## Act 2

### Scene 1

> **Framing:** montage, introduction, recognition  
> **Obstacle:** someone wants something  
> **Q:** Who wants something?  
> **Story Motif:** \[A small-time psychic, offering details of a crime only the killer could know.] A psychic friend of Seraphine can help with Abigail.   
> **Q:** Where does this take place?  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[EARTH: power, resist, nature • resilience; Tower. Alliance (Solitude). A beauty in a tower, calling, greedy for affection.] In a building, like a skyscraper; except this is a small town, so maybe just an important building. Need further clarification.  
> **A Little Magic:** \[♡ WATER, ILLUSION: abundance or luxury] It's the most luxurious building in town. It sticks out like a sore thumb.  
> **Q:** Who is she?  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[EARTH: power, resist, nature • resilience; Status Quo. Order (Rebellion). Do the ends ever justify the means?] She's a business woman with questionable ethics.  
> **Q:** How does she know Seraphine?  
> **Elemental Motif:** \[AIR: skill, strategy, society • intellect; Serpent. Self-interest (Treachery). Long-nurtured patience, rewarded.] She's Seraphine's mentor.

\[This is the end of the story for now!]
