# Summary
The story takes place in the 19th century. The character is a vampire and must lead a young student to the coven. The character finds the child at the scene of a bloodbath and convinces them that they can lead them to safety. The character is completing this task because of an agreement that they made in the past.

## Anticipations
- The three characters go adventuring.
- Love triangle between Vincent, Katherine, and Charlotte.
- Attempt to use vampire rules with the game.
- Rescue Corinna.
- Bring Margaret into the story more.

## Notes
- Katherine is a bit touched. She doesn't really care that everyone in the church was slaughtered and she is mostly upset at Vincent out of being inconvenienced. She even takes kindly to being carried away.
- ~~Who else is after Katherine?~~ Is her parents death related to this?
- ~~Why is Katherine special?~~
- ~~Who sent Vincent on the mission to retrieve Katherine?~~
- Vincent's vampire coven tends to move around, but it's currently based under a holiday themed shop. It's nearly Christmas so that's the current theme.
- ~~What is the next goal?~~
- ~~Which vampire rules should I use? WoD VtM V5 or CoD VtR?~~ I'm going with Cortex Prime (possibly switching to Classic). 
- Try using the oracle more rather than just writing.
- There are too many girls in the story. I need to add at least one guy other than Vincent.
