		  <p><strong>Campaign Elements:</strong> Swap out <em>The Pure</em> faction for <em>The Undersiders</em>, and <em>The Chosen</em> trouble for <em>Shadow Stalker</em> to better support the current narrative.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<details markdown="1">
		<summary>Campaign Elements Update</summary>
		<p>At this point in the original story, Skitter and friends were still trying to keep the two villain teams of The Pure and The Chosen from encroaching on their territory, which is why they were originally on the list. However, since I decided that The Pure is no longer an option, it makes sense to remove them from the campaign elements list.</p>
		<p>Likewise, the surprise addition of Shadow Stalker to our ranks adds a unique twist that I would like to give focus to more often, especially because of her history with Skitter (or more specifically, Sophia's history with Taylor), so I decided to swap The Chosen out for her. I personally find that a lot more interesting than fighting a bunch of racists. The chances are pretty good that the Chosen's leader, Hookwolf, will make an appearance later anyway, with or without his team, since he ended up joining the Slaughterhouse Nine in the original.</p>
		</details>

		<summary>Team Assigment</summary>
		<p>Before we get into it, I've broken combined roster of the heros and villains into four groups. They are:<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• A: Miss Militia, Clockblocker, Tattletale, Regent<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• B: Assault, Battery, Grue, Bitch<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• C: Triumph, Flechette, Vista, Imp<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• D: Weld, Glory Girl, Skitter, Shadow Stalker</p>
		<p>The important bits to focus on are:<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Miss Militia is the head of the Protectorate, which is basically the Justice League.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Clockblocker and Regent are smart-asses, so putting them on the same team could be fun. I enjoyed Clockblocker and Imp riffing off each other in the original.<br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Assault and Battery are an inseparable married couple. Battery "charges" and then releases in a burst of speed and power, and Assault redirects kinetic energy, so they have a high-speed method of travel where they kind of bounce off each other.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• I put Bitch on the same team so that Grue can ride her dogs again to keep up with the other two. The four of them together will probably be used as the bruiser team.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Flechette kind of treats Vista like a kid sister, so it make sense to pair them.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Vista is about twelve years old and Imp is only a year older, so I thought pairing the two youngest heros and villains would be interesting.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Weld is the leader of the Wards, which are basically the Teen Titans. He's made of metal and doesn't need to breathe, so he's pretty much immune to anything that Skitter could throw at him directly.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• Skitter is still unofficially charged with supervising Shadow Stalker, so of course they go on the same team.<br> 
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;• There is way too much animosity between Glory Girl and Tattletale to put them on the same team. The next most interesting option is putting her on the same team as Skitter.</p>
		</details>
		<details markdown="1">
		<summary>What's the Deal With Glory Girl?</summary>
		<p>While the bank heist thing mentioned in chapter 6 did piss off Glory Girl, why she is actually upset is due to something that neither Tattletale nor Skitter are aware of. The things that Tattletale said in the bank started a chain reaction that culminated in her adopted sister Panacea confessing her love for her and using her power to alter Glory Girl's brain chemistry so that she too had feelings of love for her sister. Panacea then panicked and ran away from home and is currently missing. It may seem illogical to blame Tattletale for this, but since she never lets anyone other than the Undersiders and Coil know how her power actually works, it's an easy conclusion to draw.</p>

		  <strong>Campaign Elements:</strong> [Save Dinah] This probably has to do Coil's response to us joining forces with the heroes.<br>
