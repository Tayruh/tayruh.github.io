		<blockquote>
		  <p>This AP uses City of Mist and Mythic 2e. It will be running the premade case <em>Gambling with Death</em> using the premade characters <em>Det. Enkidu</em>, <em>Excalibur</em>, and <em>Scarlet</em>. Since it is a premade case, it will be using the "premade adventure" event focus and "adventure features" list for Mythic.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Adventure Features:</strong> Add <em>Police Corruption</em> (which is carried over from the previous case <em>Shark Tank</em> and hinted at in this one) and assign it a progress track of 10 points. <br>
		  <strong>Characters:</strong> Add <em>Enkidu</em>, <em>Excalibur</em>, <em>Scarlet</em>, and <em>All-Seeing Eye Investigations</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Set to 5.</p>
		  <p><strong>First Scene:</strong> Enkidu got called in to investigate a death at the hotel.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Detective Enkidu clutched her umbrella, shielding herself from the rain. The drops hit hard on the concrete slabs leading up to the Royal Plaza Hotel. Puddles sparkled with the alternating red and blue light emanating from the police cruisers. Media vans were parked a short distance from the scene. Their star reporters leaned as far as they could over the police tape that cordoned off the public, trying to catch whatever glimpse that they could.</p>
		<p>Enkidu squeezed through the crowd of civilians and ducked under the yellow tape as she made her way toward the focus of their attentionâ€”a tarp covering the body. The rain hit against the tarp with a grating pitter-patter noise. The ground crunched as Enkidu came to a stop before a man crouched by the tarp. </p>
		<p>"Took your time," he said. The man was covered from head to toe in rain-proof forensics gear that hid his face, but Enkidu was familiar with that voice. Detective Johnny Nicholson. Not her favorite person, but he did his job well, which was more than she could say for the rest of her precinct.</p>
		<p>Enkidu ignored his remark and asked, "What do we have?"</p>
		<p>Nicholson pulled back the tarp just enough to show the corpse's face without exposing the evidence to the rain. "Deceased. White female. Looks to be in her mid-twenties. Time of death around 2:30am. Current evidence points to death by fall." He pointed up to give credence to his assessment.</p>
		<p>Enkidu followed his finger. Sure enough, the glass canopy above the hotel's entrance was shattered. Her gaze climbed the building, and landed on the blinding red sign of the hotel forty stories later. She whistled. "That's quite a fall. Suicide?"</p>
		<p>Nicholson grunted. "That's your job. They don't pay me enough to think outside <em>this</em> box."</p>
		<p>She dismissed his response with a wave of her hand and shifted her attention to the crowd of onlookers. She could tell at a glance that the majority of the civilians were there in macabre fascination, but a few among them were clearly distraught. Those would be her witnesses.</p>
		<p>The detective grimaced as she recognized the beat officers managing the crowd. The two cops, officers Kaminsky and Patel, were both suspected of being on the take. Enkidu made her way to them and held up her badge. "Boys." When the officers didn't respond, she asked, "What's the situation?"</p>
		<p>"Dead girl. Jumper. Lots of media," Officer Kaminsky responded in flat, clipped answers. His attention was fixed on the docile crowd and he couldn't be bothered to even look at her. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Eniku questions the cops.<br>
		  <strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction / corruption everywhere) [2, 6] + 2 = 10. Take 2 clues with <em>question//beat cops</em> method and source. Mark attention on <em>Precinct 23</em> theme.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What is the situation on the roof? (1) No signs of a struggle.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu fought an eye roll. "I can see that. What about the roof?"</p>
		<p>Kaminsky shook his head. "All clear. No signs of a struggle. She definitely jumped. Probably blew her life savings and couldn't face the music."</p>
		<p>She eyed him. "Leave the crime solving to me, hmm?"</p>
		<p>Kaminsky snorted. "Yes, ma'am."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did they notice anything out of the ordinary? (0) They point out the sequins.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu shook her head, then continued, "Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, actually," Officer Patel said. "There are these weird gold things everywhere. Like tinsel."</p>
		<p>"It's not tinsel, stupid," Kaminsky chided. "They're sequins. Big ones, like from arts and crafts." Enkidu and Patel looked at him in surprise. "What? I helped my daughter create a collage for her class using those. It beat using glitter."</p>
		<p>"Right, well, the stuff is everywhere, whatever it is. You can even see some right over there by the woman," Patel said, pointing at a collection of shimmering debris near the body.</p>
		<p>Curious about their findings, Enkidu thanked the officers for their time and returned to the body to inspect the sequins. As she peered at them, it felt like the sequins were shifting in and out of reality.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu tries to see if there is something supernatural about the sequins.<br>
		  <strong>Look Beyond the Mist:</strong> (+1 mythos) [3, 3] + 1 = 7. Take 1 clue with <em>examine//sequins</em> method and source. Answer is unreliable.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What are they really? (0) Parts of a clock?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She couldn't focus on them clearly but an image of clockwork gears overlayed the sequins, giving her a sense of double vision. She directed Nicholson to tag the sequins as evidence and made a mental note to herself to examine the woman beyond the physical when she visited the morgue later.</p>
		<p>Enkidu asked the officers for a list of witnesses and they pointed out a woman and a man from the crowd. Enkidu greeted the woman and asked her name. She was Macy Kraus.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu questions Macy.<br>
		  <strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction) [6, 6] + 3 = 15. Take 3 clues with  <em>question//Macy</em> method and source.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What did she see? (2) She saw the woman fall about 30 minutes ago.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked what she saw, and the woman said that she saw the deceased fall about half an hour ago, which lined up with Nicholson's time of death.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did she see anyone else on the roof? (1) No, and the woman didn't scream either.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The detective asked if she had seen anyone on the roof with her at that time, and Macy said that she had spotted the woman standing on the edge of the roof and then she walked right off. She didn't see anyone push her and she didn't scream on the way down, all of which added weight to the suicide theory.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What was the woman doing when she witnessed the fall? (0) [Defiant / Break] She was smoking.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked Macy where she was when she saw the woman fall, and she said that she was outside smoking. She wasn't allowed to smoke in the casino, so she had to come out here. </p>
		<p>Next she interviewed the man who introduced himself as Raymond Frank.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu questions Raymond.<br>
		  <strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction) [5, 2] + 3 = 10. Take 3 clues with <em>question//Raymond</em> method and source.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Clue:</strong> What did he see? (2) He noticed her in the casino tonight.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu asked what the man saw. He said that he wasn't around for the fall, but he noticed her in the casino earlier that night.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Was she with anyone? (1) She was alone.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She asked if the woman was all alone and Raymond said that she was, and that he regretted not making a move now.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Did he notice anything else that was unusual? (0) [Mundane / Dirty] Nothing unusual except the sequins.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>She asked if he found anything else strange tonight. The man said that the place had gold sequins everywhere, like remnants of party decorations, which was odd because there wasn't a special event that went on that night or the previous night and the place was usually very clean.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Adventure Features:</strong> Add <em>Mysterious Suicide (?)</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Decrease to 4.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Enkidu heads into hotel to question the staff. [7] Scene is as expected.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Finished with her questions, Enkidu made her way into the hotel. From the entrance she could see the reception straight ahead and the lobby and bar off to the side. Both areas were full of guests making demands of the staff.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she question the reception? (50/50) Otherwise she checks out the lobby. [20] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The reception desk was swamped with guests and it was clear that Enkidu was not going to be able to get the attention of anyone manning that station. Instead, she waited to flag down any staff member that managed to break away.</p>
		<p>A young woman stepped away from the desk, a bundle of towels in her arms. Enkidu stood in her way and held up her badge. "Excuse me. I'd like a moment of your time."</p>
		<p>The woman huffed in exasperation. "You and everyone else."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu questions the woman.<br>
		  <strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, police badge, you're in my jurisdiction / overrun-by-guests-2) [1, 4] + 1 = 6. Miss. She's interrupted.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Before Enkidu could ask any questions, a security guard appeared seemingly from out of nowhere and held a hand up to the detective. "Miss, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."</p>
		<p>She showed him her badge. "I'm investigating a death on the premises."</p>
		<p>He gently pushed the staff member away and she quickly hurried off without another word. Enkidu looked from the woman back to the guard, scowling. The man met her stare with cool eyes. "Do you have a warrant?"</p>
		<p>She lowered her badge in frustration. "No, I do not."</p>
		<p>"Get a warrant," he said shortly and gestured to the door, indicating that she should leave. Vowing to regroup and conquer, Enkidu cut her losses for now and left the hotel.</p>
		<p>She wasn't expecting to get shut down so early, but it wasn't unexpected given the owner of the establishment. Whether the woman jumped or was murdered, Kenny Lui had never been on the best of terms with the police and shutting them out was more likely a case of proactive self-defense than it was an indication of guilt. Of course, it could easily have been both, but it didn't seem like she was going to find out today.</p>
		<p>The situation outside was calming. The body had been collected and the crowd around the yellow tape had dispursed now that there wasn't anything interesting to see. Enkidu decided to follow their lead and leave as well. </p>
		<p>For a moment, the detective considered calling in the remainder of the All-Seeing Eye Investigations, her group of unofficial private investigators. The investigators were off the books because it was illegal to conduct investigations without a license and it was a conflict of interests for Detective Enkidu, but the All-Seeing Eye didn't investigate normal crimes. This city held a hidden sideâ€”a supernatural sideâ€”and some of its citizens, such as Detective Enkidu and her partners, walked on both sides. She had a strong feeling that the sequins she found earlier were also supernatural in some way.</p>
		<p>However, Enkidu also knew the sequins weren't enough to go on, so she decided to start at the morgue and follow the natural lead before jumping to the supernatural. At the very least she hoped that she could get the name of the deceased.</p>
