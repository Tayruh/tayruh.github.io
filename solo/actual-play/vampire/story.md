# Chapter 1

The church was ruined. Pews were tossed and destroyed. The nave was covered in blood and broken bodies. In the center of this massacre were a young man and woman.

Vincent stood above Katherine. She sat motionless on an untouched pew and stared back up at him. He held out a hand to her and she just stared at that as well.

"Come," Vincent said.

> **Q:** Does Katherine accept his hand? (Answer, Cooperation, Aggressiveness)  
> **Character:** \[1, 2, 6] No. She is angry and doesn't want to follow his lead.

She slapped his hand away. "Leave me."

The two stood in silence among the bodies and ruin. Vincent waited for Katherine to do or say anything, but she outlasted the vampire.

"We do not have time for this, Katherine. You can either walk beside me, or I will carry you," he said.

She crossed her arms in a pout. "You will have to carry me then," the young girl said in a huff.

Without a moment to waste, Vincent leaned forward and easily scooped the blonde up into his arms. She let out a yelp of surprise and quickly slung an arm around his neck for stability. He carried her out of the church like a newly wed couple crossing the threshold.

He carried her like this down the street. He did his best to stick to the shadows, primarily out of habit since the streets were nearly empty and hiding was unnecessary.

Katherine rested her head against his chest. "Where are you taking me?" she asked.

"Someplace safe."

"Safe? I was safe in the church before you slaughtered the entire clergy."

"That place was not safe. There are others looking for you. They could not defend you."

She closed her eyes and sighed. "Clearly not."

"I will protect you. Do not worry."

"I'm being delivered to an unknown destination by the monster that I just watched kill my last remaining relative. Why should I worry?"

"You jest, but your uncle was a greater monster than I. That church was diseased."

"My uncle, he.. well.. he didn't lay a hand on me, but I was always afraid." She shuddered and instinctively nuzzled up deeper into Vincent's chest. "I will not miss him."

Vincent remained silent. After a few moments, he pet her hair to comfort her. He thought he could hear her sigh.

It wasn't long before they appeared before the run down trinket store. As it was nearing the Christmas holiday, the store was stocked with seasonal supplies and decorated with signs of the holiday.  It was nearly midnight and the store had long since closed. Vincent let himself in.

After crossing the threshold with Katherine in his arms, he gently lowered her to feet. "Follow me," he said and walked toward the back of the room. He opened a door at the back of the shop and descended a set of stairs.

Katherine hesitated to follow him. For a moment she considered running but instead weighed her options. He was fast and would no doubt catch her, likely before she even left the shop. Additionally, there was allegedly another group out to get her and she couldn't guarantee that they would treat her as kindly as Vincent had thus far--murder of familial members aside.

'Better the devil you know,' she thought to herself and followed Vincent down the stairs.

> **Q:** Is it as expected? (Yes/And, Straight, Danger)  
> **Story:** \[3, 6, 2] What I expected was a den full of vampires, but instead it's completely vacant. It doesn't appear to be dangerous though and Vincent's master is still here.

As Vincent walked down the hallway towards his master's room, it became apparent that the place was empty. Bedroom doors were left ajar and the dining area and rest area were vacant. He became suspicious of whether his master was even here, but he knocked on the door nonetheless and was invited in by a voice beyond the door.

Vincent entered with Katherine behind his back. He instinctively shielded her, the state of the den putting his guard up.

The room was empty with the exception of his master who was seated at her desk.

> **Story:** \[3, 3, 5] There is dramatic romantic tension between the two and they may have slept together once or twice but they are not a couple.

> **Q:** Does Vincent's master consider him an equal? (Answer, Curiosity, Cooperation)  
> **Character:** \[4, 6, 3] Yes and no. She has been enthralled by him since he first met him as a mortal and has never wanted him to leave her side, and so she would never treat him like a lesser being, but at the same time she always makes sure he knows who wears the pants in the relationship.

"Vincent, my sweet. You've returned," Charlotte said. She was leaned back in her chair with her feet resting on her desk and her hands behind her head.

"Yes. I have brought the girl as you've requested," he said.

"Excellent!" Charlotte clapped her hands together. "I trust there were no difficulties?"

"There were complications, but nothing that I couldn't handle."

She narrowed her eyes and tried to read his face, something that she always had trouble with. "Are we going to need a cleanup crew?"

He lowered his head. "I'm sorry, Master."

She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. "Quit with that 'master' nonsense. You know I hate that."

"Yes, M--" he caught himself and repeated, "Yes."

Charlotte just rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Bring the girl here."

Vincent grabbed Katherine's wrist and together they crossed the room to stand before Charlotte. In the blink of an eye Charlotte had moved from the prone resting position in her chair to perched at the edge of her desk.

"Ooh, she's pretty. Not prettier than me, I hope?" Charlotte shot a sidewise glance at Vincent with a smirk.

"When compared with your beauty, all are like a candle and you are the sun," Vincent said in a monotone rehearsed manner.

Charlotte playfully pushed his shoulder. "You dork."

Katherine looked back and forth between the two. She was starting to feel more uncomfortable about their interactions than the fact that she was standing in a vampire den.

"If I may ask," Vincent began, "where is everyone? Why are we alone?"

"Are you afraid to be alone with me, Vincent?" Charlotte waggled her eyebrows in a playfully seductive manner. She was met with Vincent's blank stare. "Gah. You're no fun." She threw her hands up and pushed herself off the desk.

> **Q:** Why are they alone?  
> **Why:** \[Connected Bureaucracy] The other members voted her out, basically.  
> 
> **Q:** What'd she do wrong?  
> **What:** \[Lineage of World] They are upset about her favoring Vincent all of the time.


She paced around the office. "You want to know why we're alone? They left me, Vincent. Left *us*. They're gone and we were discarded like trash."

"What? Why?"

"You, honestly." She looked at Vincent like she could burst into tears any second. "Or rather, it was my treatment of you. It's no secret that you're my favorite. The others got tired of my favoritism. They said"--she dropped into a lower octave and put her hands on her hips--"'It's either him or us.'" She sighed. "It was never a choice. It was always going to be you."

"Charlotte... I don't know what to say." Vincent said.

She just shook her head. "There's nothing to say. I'm weak. You make me weak. But I don't even care. It's better this way."

The room went quiet. Vincent and Charlotte were trapped in their heads with what-ifs and what-may-have-beens.

Awkwardly, Katherine broke the silence. "Excuse me, but why am I here?"

"You," Charlotte said as she spun to face Katherine with a grin, "are going to help me wake my sire! I'm so excited!"

"I'm what?"

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Wake Corinna? But she was sealed away for being a traitor, wasn't she?"

> **Q:** Did Charlotte ever tell Vincent the story of Corinna? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Sympathy)  
> **Story:** \[5, 2, 3] She did, but she only gave the vaguest of details, so Vincent has a difficult time understanding what Charlotte is thinking.

"It's complicated. I know you've mostly heard only rumors, but you'll have to trust me."

"Of course I trust you," Vincent said without missing a beat.

"Then you have nothing to worry about," Charlotte said with a large grin. "This is going to be great!"

"But Master, why revive her now?"

She leaned back against her desk. "Well, I originally requested that you retrieve this girl so that I could revive--or perhaps only threaten to revive--Corinna for leverage. I could feel the tide turning against us, so I decided to use my trump card." She shrugged with an exasperated smile. "But I guess it's too late for that. I misjudged how eager they were to abandon us."

"Okay, but if the opportunity has passed, then why still revive her?"

"This place is a dump, Vincent. Don't you agree? This dingy basement below a Christmas shoppe."

Vincent looked around the room and shrugged. He had taken residence in places much worse than this.

"It's a dump," Charlotte reaffirmed. "I want out. If we no longer have to concern ourselves with a coven then there is no reason to stay here. We can return to traveling the world again. Remember how life used to be? Just you and I with nothing to hold us down."

He nodded. He did remember and had fond memories of those times. "And Corinna?"

"I can't leave her, Vincent." She sighed. "I could accept her being sealed when she was just right over there," she waved her arm haphazardly in the directly of the other coven, "but I can't leave town with her like that. I can't abandon her, regardless of what the charges are against her."

"A jailbreak then?" he asked.

She gave a devilish grin. "A jailbreak."

> **Q:** Is Katherine accepting all of this? (Answer, Curiosity, Cooperation)  
> **Character:** \[6, 2, 1] She is okay with going along with what they're suggesting since she basically has nothing else now, but she also doesn't have any personal interest in what Charlotte wants and doesn't intend to be proactive at all.

Katherine sat in Charlotte's desk chair. "That all sounds great. I hope you enjoy yourselves. I'll be waiting here until you get back."

Charlotte chuckled. "You silly girl, you're coming  with us. We need you on site to revive Corinna. Not to mention that you'll undoubtedly run the moment you leave our sight."

Katherine frowned. The thought had obviously crossed her mind, but where would she even go?

"Should we attack tonight?" Vincent asked.

> **Q:** Should they? (Answer, Motivation, Directness)  
> **Character:** \[2, 2, 5] Nope. Charlotte isn't in the mood.

Charlotte sighed in such a manner that she resembled a deflating balloon. "Not tonight, please. It's been a trying night and Corinna can stand to hibernate one more day. Tonight I want cuddles."

"Cuddles," Vincent repeated.

"Yes! With the coven gone, I no longer need to pretend that you are just another clan member. I apparently wasn't very good at hiding it anyway, but now I can dote on you to my heart's content. And so: cuddles." She grinned at Vincent like a child on Christmas Day.

"I see. Cuddles it is then."

Katherine rose from her seat. "Right, well, have fun. It's after midnight and I'm going to sleep."

"I don't think so, Missy," Charlotte said with her hands on her hips. "You're staying up with us. We can't have you passing out from sleep deprivation in the middle of our raid tomorrow. You'll sleep when we do to sync your schedule."

She groaned. "Fine. But can you at least start a fire? It's freezing in here and I'm not cold blooded like you are."

And so the three of them passed the night away in front of the fireplace, which was actually the boiler in the basement. Vincent and Charlotte sat on a couch, Charlotte draped herself all over Vincent, and they conversed all night. 

Katherine sat in a separate chair and keep quiet. Every time she began to nod off, Charlotte poked her cheek with her finger.

Eventually the sun rose, at which time Charlotte sealed Katherine away in a storage room furnished with a cot. Charlotte returned to her bedroom, dragging Vincent with her. She snuggled up to Vincent as they drifted off to sleep in her bed.

# Chapter 2

> **Q:** Is the next scene as expected? (Yes/And, Straight, Danger)  
> **Story:** \[6, 6, 6, Turn: A sudden turn in favor of the Big Bad or other forces aligned against the main characters and their interests] I expected the characters to sneak into the castle, and I expected it to be dangerous, but it's made worse because the members that left Charlotte's coven have joined this one and are expecting her.  
> 
> - Castle  
> 	- **Locations:** 1-4: Expected, 5-6: Hallway, 7: Random, 8: Rest Area, 9: Expected, 10: Dining Room, 11: Throne Room, 12: Barracks, 13: Corinna  
> 	- **Encounters:** 1-3: None, 4-5: Guard, 6: None, 7: Random, 8: Friendly, 9: Boss

Charlotte and company arrived at the castle just after nightfall. Rather than approaching the gate, the group traversed to the darkest corner of the castle wall. The castle walls may keep out humans but they were nothing to vampires.

Katherine latched onto Vincent's back with her arms wrapped tightly around his shoulders. Charlotte gave side-eyed looks from apparent jealousy, but there wasn't any other way to get the human over the wall.

The cobblestone walls of the castle provided convenient handholds and Vincent and Charlotte quickly ascended to the top of the wall.

> **Q:** Is there a lookout at the top? (Mixed, Straight, Favorability)  
> **Story** \[3, 2, 4] Not here at least.

They couldn't be sure that there weren't guards posted at other stations along the castle wall, but they were fortunate enough to select an unguarded section of the wall. They were safe for now.

The trio descended the near stairs and entered the castle. 

> **Q:** Does Charlotte know where she's going? (Mixed, Straight, Favorability)  
> **Story:** \[3, 3, 2] Sort of. She's only heard rumors, so she only has a general idea where Corinna might be held, and she isn't even sure if it's good intel.  
> 
> **Location:** \[5+0, 4+0] Hallway and guards.  
> 
> **Q:** Does Charlotte spot them first?  
> **Difficulty:** 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: \[5,2,6] = 11 (d6)  
> **Charlotte:** Vampire Princess d8 + Alertness d10 + Duty d8 + Vampire d10: \[4,10,7,5] = 17 (d10) + Heroic Success

Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs, Charlotte immediately spotted a pair of guards at the end of the hallway. Thankfully they didn't spot her as well and she managed to sneak into the doorway off to the side. She turned back and waved the others on.

> **Q:** Does Vincent make it?  
> **Difficulty:** 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: \[4,6,6] = 12 (d8)  
> **Vincent:** Warrior d8 + Agility d6 + Duty d10 + Vampire d8: \[4,4,1,5] = 13 (d4) + Hitch; Spent 1 PP to keep extra die and had to take d4 effect die.  
> **Q:** What is the hitch?  
> **What:** \[Witnessed Information] The guard saw evidence of entry; bought for 1 PP. It'll be a "Suspicious d6" complication if they come back through this hallway.

> **Q:** Does Katherine make it?  
> **Difficulty:** 2d6 + Vampire Guard d8: \[5,6,5] = 11 (d8)  
> **Katherine:** Blood Sacrifice d8 + Agility d8 + Glory d4: \[8,4,2] = 12 (d4)

The three of them sneaked past the guard but Vincent bumped an end table on the way out and it caught the guard's attention. The trio were already long gone, but the guard had become suspicious and going back this way would be difficult.

> **Location:** \[3+1,1+1] Expected location and no encounters.

The next room that they entered was empty. It was a fairly nondescript room with nothing of interest so they continued through.

> **Location:** \[2+2,4+2] Expected location and no encounters.

The following room appeared to be more of the same. Charlotte was beginning to wonder if she actually knew where she was going. Perhaps she had bad intel after all.

> **Location:** \[1+3,5+3] Expected location and friendly encounter.

> 	- Identity: Wizard  
> 	- Descriptor: Longing For The Younger Years and Striking

> 	- Goals: Execute Poverty; Convey Propaganda; Oppress others

> **Q:** How does she look?  
> **Adjective:** \[Powerfully Fiery] She has bright red hair that stands out against her pale skin. She's very beautiful and exudes a sense of power from her presence.  
> 
> **Q:** Is she as expected? (Mixed, Straight, Drama)  
> **Story:** \[5, 1, 6] I expected Margeret to be friendly towards Vincent rather than Charlotte, which would make her jealous. The oracle agrees and sets the drama level to high.

As if to answer her concerns, the next turn led them straight into a command room, not unlike her own. In it was a desk and behind it stood Margaret.

The red-haired woman appeared to have been glancing over some documents on their arrival, but her head snapped up to spot them the moment that they appeared.

"Why, if it isn't my lovely Vincent. How are you, my sweet?" The voluptuous woman gracefully skirted around the desk and latched onto his arm. Margaret beamed at him but then her smile withered into a grimace once she glanced over his shoulder. "Oh. I see your keeper tagged along as well."

"Hello, Margaret," Charlotte said flatly and unamused.

Margaret ignored Charlotte and returned her attention to Vincent. "I haven't seen you in ages. What brings you to my humble lair?"

"We came to retrieve something of ours," Vincent said matter-of-factly. Charlotte gasped at how he showed their hand.

Margaret rubbed her cheek on Vincent's shoulder like a kitten. "Something? Or some*one*?" she asked, peering up at him to search his face.

When he didn't answer she just sighed. "Why her? Corinna has been ours for decades and you only just now come to her rescue. What changed?"

"If you must know," Charlotte said as she stepped forward and gave Margaret a light shove to separate her from Vincent, "we are leaving this city and we're not leaving her behind."

Margaret giggled and let Charlotte push her away, happy to have gotten the reaction that she was looking for.

"Do you know where she is?" Vincent asked Margaret.

"Hmmm.. I don't know. Do I?" the red-head feigned ignorance.

"Margaret. Please," Vincent said.

> **Q:** Can he convince Margaret?  
> **Margaret:** 2d6 + Sucker for Vincent d4: \[5,2,2] = 7 (d4)  
> **Vincent:** Servant d8 + Willpower d10 + Duty d10: \[6,1,10] = 16 (d4) + Heroic Success + Hitch  
> **Hitch:** Margaret demands to tag along; bought for 1 PP.

She was quiet for a minute, as if weighing her options, and then a smile crept across her face. "I will show you."

"What do you mean 'show us'?" Charlotte asked.

"I will guide you." Margaret glomped onto Vincent's arm. "After all, I can't let my Vinciepoo fall into a trap, can I? I would worry so!"

Charlotte narrowed her eyes. "Lead the way, tramp."

Margaret cackled as she practically dragged Vincent out of the room by his elbow.

> **Q:** Do they make it to Corinna without incident? (Mixed, Straight, Drama)  
> **Story:** \[5, 5, 6] They manage to avoid any suspicion, but Charlotte has had about enough of Margaret.  
> 
> **Q:** What does the room look like?  
> **Descriptor:** \[Perfectly Lonely] The room contains only Corinna and not much else.

The group traveled through the castle, following Margaret's lead. Charlotte was loath to admit it, but having Margaret declare their path was crucial, since she not only knew the exact location Corinna, but also the location of all guard patrols. They didn't meet a soul on their way to where Corinna was sealed.

"Well, this is drab," Charlotte said upon arriving as their destination.

The room was a dark holding cell. There was absolutely nothing to see other than an elaborately decorated coffin in the center of the room.

"A coffin? I thought those were just fiction," Katherine said.

"They *are* fiction. Vanessa thinks that she's being cute," Charlotte said while grimacing at Margaret. Margaret just smiled and shrugged.

Vincent stepped toward the box. "Right. So, how do we do this?"

> **Q:** How *are* they going to do this?  
> **How:** \[Reception of Magic] Margaret magically charges Katherine.

\[That's it for my story so far!]
