		  <p><mark>BACKGROUND</mark><br>
		  A year ago, Enkidu was investigating a cry for help written on a mysterious note, which quickly lead to the discovery of a deep mafia influence backed by persons with supernatural powers. Attempts to investigate further were shut down by her superiors, who were obviously in the pocket of the mob, so she started her own unofficial investigation.</p>
		  <p>While following up on the rumor of a stylist dating one of the local mob bosses, Enkidu found a woman wearing a mystical bracelet standing outside of a hair salon. The woman was Excalibur and she had regularly patroned the establishment while in disguise, gathering local gossip to keep an eye on the district. The salon was not the only victim, and shops across the district had closed under the pressure of the mafia. Excalibur offered to lend her power and financial backing to remove the mafia influence from Miller's Square and Enkidu gratefully accepted.</p>
		  <p>During the course of their investigation, Enkidu and Excalibur came across Scarlet, a young girl who was out of her mind with worry over the abduction of her girlfriend Jill. It appeared that Jill had caught the eye of the mafia consigliere and he used his supernatural power of suggestion to enamor her, collecting her as a pet to keep in the backroom of his speakeasy.</p>
		  <p>The group freed Scarlet's girlfriend and discovered the source of the enforcers' supernatural abilities: a yearly feast of Ambrosia, a magical dish that grants godlike powers. They raided the feast and defeated the consigliere and a small army of mafia enforcers. Also present was a crazy shark lady enforcer and an ominous man controlling three dogs, but the pair escaped with a crate of Ambrosia.</p>
		  <p>Though the Ambrosia supply line had been cut, the shark lady later re-emerged to take the consigliere's place as the one controlling Miller's Square. Enkidu swore to continue her mission of freeing Miller's Square from the mafia influence and removing the corruption from her precinct. This aligned with Excalibur's goals and so she offered to lend her services when she could. Scarlet, grateful for the help in rescuing her girlfriend, also agreed to provide assistance, outside of school hours. The trio set up an informal base of operations in a closed-down office left behind by one of Enkidu's old colleagues. They tentatively named it "All-Seeing Eye Investigations."</p>
