		  <p><strong>Traits:</strong> distinctions + sfx, values + statements, attributes, powers, specialities, goals <br>

		  <strong>Dice Rolling:</strong> advantage of scale<br>

		  <strong>Plot Points:</strong> starting plot points: 1<br>
		  <strong>Game Narrator Characters:</strong> bosses, extras, location GMCs, minor GMCs, catalysts</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Distinctions:</strong> The three distinctions are standout traits (whether positive or negative) that best describe this character. Each are d8 and come with the standard SFX of "Hinder: Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction's rating for a d4." Assign three more SFX across the three distinctions. Premade SFX taken from Tales of Xadia.</p>
		  <p><strong>Relationships:</strong> You are given one d10, two d8s, and two d6s to assigned to relationships. Each has a trait statement. All relationships not assigned a die are assumed to be a d4.</p>
		  <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> You are given three d8s and three d6s to be assigned to the attributes <em>Agility, Awareness, Intellect, Presence, Spirit, and Strength</em>. You may step down an attribute to step up another, but not below d4 or above d10.</p>
		  <p><strong>Power Sets:</strong> The number of power sets are not fixed—humans usually have none, myths usually have only one, and more powerful myths have two or three. For each set you're given two d10s to be assigned to powers in that set. You may step down a power to add another power to that set at the same size. All power sets come with "Limit: Shut down a power in this set to gain a PP. Restore with an opportunity or in the next scene." If it doesn't make narrative sense to single out a power to be shut down, the entire set is shut down for only 1 PP. Power sets do not have SFX as they will be handled through distinction SFX.</p>
		  <p><strong>Specialties:</strong> You're given two d10s to be assigned to the specialties <em>Craft, Drive, Fight, Fix, Fly, Focus, Influence, Know, Labor, Move, Notice, Operate, Perform, Shoot, Sneak, Survive, Throw, Treat, and Trick</em>. You may step down a specialty to add another specialty at the same size. Know must have an area of expertise, and requires an additional Know specialty for each additional area. </p>
		  <p><strong>Stress:</strong> The stress types are <em>Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, Injured, and Insecure</em>. Myths also have <em>Monstrous</em>.</p>
		  <p><strong>Goals:</strong> You may have up to three goals active at once. Assign a goal by describing what you want to accomplish in connection with a relationship, then give it a die rating between d6 and d12 to represent its difficulty. Its rating cannot be higher than the connected relationship rating.</p>
		  <p><strong>Earning Plot Points:</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Roll a hitch that the GM activates<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Give in during a contest <br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate an SFX like Hinder<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Engage in remarkable moments of roleplaying </p>
		  <p><strong>Spending Plot Points:</strong><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate SFX <br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <del>Add two dice from a trait set instead of one</del><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Activate an opportunity that the GM rolls<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <del>Avoid being taken out</del><br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Create a d6 asset for a single test, contest, or challenge<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Keep an asset for the rest of the session<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Include an additional result in your total<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Interfere in a contest<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Keep an extra effect die<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• Share an asset with everyone in a scene</p>

		  <strong>Housemaster</strong> d8<br>
		  Although this role was dumped onto him by his father, Seth takes his position seriously. He does whatever it takes to provide a good life for those in his care.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Just Another Day:</em> Spend a PP to convert your Afraid, Angry, or Insecure stress into Exhausted stress. If you already had Exhausted stress, step it up.</p>
		  <p><strong>Protective</strong> d8<br>
		  Seth has always been overprotective of his little sister Erin. After taking on the role of housemaster, this has extended to include the lodgers residing within the mansion.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Get Behind Me:</em> Gain a PP when you put yourself in danger to protect someone else.</p>
		  <p><strong>Never Enough for Father</strong> d8<br>
		  While Walter isn't exactly affectionate toward Erin, he always expects something more of Seth. No matter how hard Seth tries, he remains a disappointment to his father.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>I Can Do Better:</em> When you fail a roll to beat your opponent in a contest or challenge, spend a PP to reroll your dice pool and try again. You must keep the result of this new roll. If you succeed, step up your effect die by one. If you fail again, step up any stress you take.</p>
		  <p><mark>RELATIONSHIPS</mark><br>

		<blockquote>
		  <p><mark>DISTINCTIONS</mark><br>
		  <strong>Kumiho</strong> d8<br>
		  Seoyon is a fabled Korean nine-tailed fox spirit. Kumiho are foxes in their natural form and transform into beautiful women to lure men, whom they kill by consuming their spirit energy.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Mimicry:</em> Spend a PP to mimic a sound, voice, or behavior, giving yourself or an ally a d8 asset for a single test, contest, or challenge.</p>
		  <p><strong>Sly as a Fox</strong> d8<br>
		  Seoyon is cunning, and while she always conveys a sense of honesty, one should never fully trust her intentions or believe what she says.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Oath Shattered:</em> Gain a PP when you break a promise.<br>
		   &nbsp;&nbsp;• <em>Yeah, I Really Do:</em> When trying to mislead someone, spend a PP to double this distinction die in your dice pool and keep an extra die in your total.</p>
		  <p><strong>On the Run</strong> d8<br>
		  Although she has never been forthcoming about her past, it's apparent that something nasty went down in Korea and Seoyon is trying to hide as far away from there as she can.</p>
		  <p><mark>RELATIONSHIPS</mark><br>
