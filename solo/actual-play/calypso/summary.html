<blockquote>
<p>The sleepy town of Darkness Falls hides demons.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda:</strong> Fill the protagonist’s life with darkness
and horror; throw the light into stark relief.<br />
<strong>Principle:</strong> Juxtapose the normal and the horrific, the
mundane and the uneasily other.</p>
<p><strong>Answer Early:</strong> The authority here has a priority;
what is it? What mystery draws you here? Is this a homecoming? You
aren’t welcome; why? Roll motifs, elemental or on the facing page, for
inspiration.<br />
<strong>Clock.</strong> On a match, roll a motif and narrate an oddity
inspired by it, playing a soft Dramatic Move in the process. On 0, show
how the horror costs you something you care about.<br />
<strong>Premise Beats.</strong> Someone reacts excessively to my
questions | lashes out | sets a trap | tries to seduce me | uses dark
powers | abuses authority.<br />
<strong>Play to Find out:</strong> What will staring into the abyss cost
me?</p>
<p><strong>Motif:</strong> A dead man’s daughter, attacked by a fiend a
year to a day after his death.<br />
<strong>Motif:</strong> A witch, surrounded by ritual and sacrifice,
claiming innocence.<br />
<strong>Ominous place:</strong> A small town in a big forest, haunted,
where time doesn’t flow as it should.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1 MOTIFS OF SHADOWS</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>A dead man’s daughter, attacked by a fiend a year to a day after his
death.</li>
<li>A witness, in hiding and armed, but unaware that the hunter draws
near.</li>
<li>The letter said to come, so I did; I owe them that much.</li>
<li>A reporter, certain of the facts, missing in the woods.</li>
<li>A gathering of people, the will read, the winner whoever survives
the night.</li>
<li>A chance encounter, and an offer to help unwittingly made to a
ghost.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 MOTIFS OF THE VEIL</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>An unwelcome inheritance, dreams of a stranger, a clue in the
earth.</li>
<li>An experiment gone awry, that which has been opened unable to be
closed, the unseen seen and looking back.</li>
<li>A small-time psychic, offering details of a crime only the killer
could know.</li>
<li>Madness plaguing the set of a film about madness, contagious like
the flu.</li>
<li>A witch, surrounded by ritual and sacrifice, claiming
innocence.</li>
<li>Twenty-one years ago it opened, and they disappeared. It’s almost
time again.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 CHARACTERS</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>A promiscuous witch, a little too happy to help, but full of
secrets.</li>
<li>The one I swore to protect, now undead, taken from me.</li>
<li>The master of the dead, the unhinged woman in blue, the one
controlling it all.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

<li><strong>The Key of the Skeptic:</strong> Hit this key when you
dismiss the supernatural in favor of a rational explanation. Change:
accept the supernatural at face value.</li>
<li><strong>The Key of Vice:</strong> You're a sucker for a pretty
woman. Hit this Key when you indulge in your vice. Change: swear off the
vice.</li>
<li><strong>Learned to Cope [Edge]:</strong> You have a wide variety of
coping mechanisms. When you face mind-bending horror, you may take a
rank-1 coping condition (or increase one by 1 rank) to move a roll
result up one step.
<ul>
<li><em>1-3:</em> talkative, lash out, binge, cruel, fleeing, go
blank</li>

<li><strong>A Cold Callous Angel [Edge]:</strong> It feels like
someone’s watching out for you, but they don’t seem to care about anyone
else. When you would gain a physical Condition, roll an extra d6; on a

do.</li>
