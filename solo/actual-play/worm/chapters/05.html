		<p>The sound of conversation and tinny explosions pulls me from my sleep. I open my eyes a crack to see Grue pacing back and forth in the lounge. Tattletale is seated beside me on the couch. My feet are resting on her lap with my head laid against the armrest.</p>
		<p>"Good morning, sleepy," Tattletale says as she pets my feet.</p>
		<p>"Hey," I murmur in a haze.</p>
		<p>I glance about the room while remaining sprawled across the couch. It seems the gang is all here. Imp and Regent are at the far end of the room, seated before a large television and viciously battling each other in some video game, the apparent source of the explosions that woke me. Shadow Stalker is seated diagonally in an armchair, a leg slung over the armrest and an arm laid across the headrest, feigning casualness while keeping a wary eye on Regent. Bitch is seated on the floor with Angelica and Bastard, hand-feeding them from a bag of dogfood that Grue keeps on hand for such a purpose.</p>
		<p>"It's about time you woke up, dork," Regent calls over his shoulder. "We've been waiting forever."</p>
		<p>I push myself up to a seated position. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"Pffft. Ignore him. You've had a rough day," Tattletale says, and pats my leg in consolation, "which is why we're here. Plans have obviously changed and we need to adjust."</p>
		<p>I groan and nod. "Yeah. The Pure is a bust. Though I'm not too heartbroken about that."</p>
		<p>Grue gives a half chuckle in agreement.</p>
		<p>Tattletale smirks. "Such a shame, right? But this does put a kink in Coil's plans and our fight against the Nine. We really needed that extra firepower."</p>
		<p>I grimace. Coil gave me one simple task, to recruit the help of The Pure, and I couldn't even do that. It wasn't through any fault of my own, but where does that put me? Will that be counted as a strike against me in his eyes, costing me ground in my mission to free Dinah? It's so difficult to tell with Coil.</p>
		<p>Tattletale frowns at me. "Stop that. I know what you're thinking. We'll fix this."</p>
		<p>"How?" Grue asks abruptly. "Who is left to recruit? Faultline's Crew? We're not dealing with those Chosen fuckers."</p>
		<p>"I don't think the Chosen are an option anyway," Tattletale says. "A little bird told me that they got taken out by Shatterbird last night. I think she may have attempted to recruit Hookwolf."</p>
		<p>"Fuuuck," Grue groans. "That's just what we need; to fight that asshole as part of the Nine."</p>
		<p>I shake my head. "We'll worry about that later. As for Faultline's Crew, I don't know how much help they'd be. Labyrinth is the only member with a strong power, and it's not an offensive one."</p>
		<p>Grue huffs a sigh. "Then I guess we're on our own."</p>
		<p>"No..," I say, almost a whisper. "There's another group."</p>
		<p>Tattletale leans forward. "Are you thinking the heroes?"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker lets out a long groan. "Fuck no. Not them."</p>
		<p>The three us of turn stare at her. Tattletale is the first to speak up. "That's not really your call to make."</p>
		<p>"Right?" calls Imp without tearing her eyes from the screen. "Why are you even here?"</p>
		<p>Grue crosses his arms. "That's actually a great question. I'd love to hear this."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker groans again and lays her head against the headrest, gazing at the ceiling. "Thanks to that fuckhead over there," her eyes flick to Regent, "I can't be a hero anymore. I can't even go back to being a vigilante because now I'm a fucking outlaw. I don't have a home either, thanks to him. I have nothing."</p>
		<p>Grue's voice is deep when he says, "If you're looking for a pity party, you won't find any here. We know the story between you and Skitter. I don't condone what Regent did, but you deserve everything you got."</p>
		<p>She glares at Grue. "I'll deal. I'm a survivor. I'm a predator."</p>
		<p>"I'm a <em>predator</em>," Imp mimics. "Sooo scary." Then she gasps. "Fuck, Regent! That was my power up, you dick!" Regent laughs.</p>
		<p>Tattletale rolls her eyes at the children then turns to Shadow Stalker. "What is it that you expect to get out of this?"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker shrugs. "A place to crash. A paycheck. Some villains to take out my aggression on."</p>
		<p>"We fight heroes too, you know," Tattletale reminds her.</p>
		<p>"The villains, the heroes, the cops. They're all after me whether I'm with you or on my own."</p>
		<p>"Look. The fact is, I don't trust you, Shadow Stalker. You're a horrible, hateful person," Tattletale says bluntly. "However, I do trust Skitter. Despite everything you've done to her, she is vouching for you. I can't understand it, honestly, but that's our Skitter. She believes in second chances. I don't. But I have faith in her, and through her, I am putting my faith you. Do <em>not</em> make me regret this."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker looks from Tattletale to me. I meet her eyes but don't respond. Her expression is difficult to read. It's angry—it's always angry—but there's something more. Reevaluating me?</p>
		<p>She returns her gaze to Tattletale and says harshly, "Fine."</p>
		<p>The conversation dies there and the only sounds in the room are those of the television and the tapping of buttons on game controllers. Awkwardly, I pipe up, "So, the heroes?"</p>
		<p>"Do you think they'll play ball?" Grue asks, turning his attention to me.</p>
		<p>"Maybe," Tattletale says. "They've been hands-off since we moved in, but it's their city too. It's their duty to protect it. The Slaughterhouse Nine technically classifies as an S-Class threat, so it makes sense that they'd call a truce to team up against them."</p>
		<p>"Should we contact them tonight?" I ask, not especially feeling up to the task.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Tattletale think we should contact them right away? She always thinks Taylor pushes herself too hard, so it doesn't seem likely. (Small Chance) [53] No, we should prepare first.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"No, Skitter," Tattletale says with a gentle smile and a pat on my leg. "Take the rest of the day off. Prepare. Heal. We can contact them tomorrow."</p>
		<p>"Maybe you can show Shadow Stalker her new quarters in the meantime," Grue suggests, sounding nonplussed.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker snorts and I frown at her. "Yeah, alright," I say, defeated. "I guess this was inevitable. Let's head back to my lair and get you situated."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I think it's possible that we get interrupted on the way back. <br>
		  <strong>Set a Course:</strong> (+4 supply) [7, 4 vs 9] Strong hit. Take +1 momentum (10). It's actually a pleasant trip.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Shadow Stalker and I walk back to my lair. Things are still not great between us—I don't know if they ever will be—but I can feel the tension easing. She is walking beside me, for a change. She doesn't know where we're going, so I still need to lead her, but at least she's not trailing like a lost puppy any longer.</p>
		<p>As we get closer to our destination, she speaks up, "The Boardwalk, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah," I reply without elaboration.</p>
		<p>"I knew this was your territory, but I never made the connection. Doesn't your dad work here?" She's making small talk?</p>
		<p>"Yeah," I say again. "From the Boardwalk to the Docks. This place means a lot to him and his workers, so when Coil was assigning territories, I asked for this one."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker looks around as we walk. "It doesn't look bad, considering. The Boardwalk used to be the shithole of Brockton Bay, but this actually looks better than the rest of the city."</p>
		<p>I nod. "We've built something of a community here. I provide protection, food, clean water, rodent-free homes, and electricity to the people. All I ask for in return is that they help with the labor to restore the city after the fallout from Leviathan."</p>
		<p>She looks at me. "And that works?"</p>
		<p>I wave my hand at the territory around us. "You can see that it does."</p>
		<p>As if on cue, we enter an area of the Boardwalk in which a group of twenty or more men—from teens to their sixties—are working together to break down rubble and load it into a truck for disposal elsewhere. Behind them are fold-out tables loaded with food and drink for the workers. I can spot Sierra—one of my employees—among the crowd, her bright red cornrows sabotaging whatever anonymity that her mask is attempting to provide. She is directing the workers while ensuring that they are fed and hydrated. She notices me and waves, and I wave back.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker shakes her head, in disbelief, I think. "Not fucking bad, Taylor."</p>
		<p>"Skitter," I correct. She scowls at me, so I elaborate, "When we're in costume, we use our cape names. It'd be bad if anyone overheard and our identities were revealed. I don't worry about me; I worry about my dad."</p>
		<p>"Does he know?" she asks surprised.</p>
		<p>"No..," I say sadly and let the answer hang.</p>
		<p>In a surprise gesture of consolation, Shadow Stalker says, "Yeah, well, my mother knew. Trust me, it's better that he doesn't know."</p>
		<p>I nod and leave it at that. While I appreciate the olive branch, she's not telling me anything that I don't already know. Sophia had a falling out with her mother over her cape life, and Sophia was a <em>hero</em>. Technically. I'm a villain. I dread the day when my dad discovers that his innocent daughter has become a freaking warlord that controls a sizable portion of the city. While I haven't killed, I <em>have</em> maimed, held persons hostage, robbed a bank, nearly asphyxiated persons with bugs, carved out a man's eyes… A far cry from my dream of being a hero. I think my dad would have been proud of me as a hero. But this? No. Not even with the good that I've done for the city.</p>
		<p>We arrive at the back entrance to my lair a couple minutes later. This time we took the roundabout path to protect our identities, not the location. Everyone knows where Skitter's lair is, but they don't know that I am Skitter. If they keep seeing a skinny teen with long, curly black hair enter and leave the same building as the skinny supervillain with long, curly black hair, they will put two and two together quickly.</p>
		<p>The secret entrance to my lair is a giant storm drain that faces the shore. Upon entering, I reach for Shadow Stalker's hand. She crosses her arms and gives me an incredulous glare. I shake my hand insistently and she takes it with reluctance. I lead her into the tunnels, hand in hand, and pull her along the necessary turns. After just a couple turns, we are in complete darkness. This is where my minions would need to drag a hand along the wall to feel their way, holding their breath as they count the steps across an intersection without walls on either side, but my bugs map out the area clearly and I navigate it in confidence.</p>
		<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel, and we enter it to arrive at my lair.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><del><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Did Charlotte leave yet? It's still the same day, so probably not. (Unlikely) [9] Yes. She skedaddled quick!</del><br>
		  I overruled this result because I decided that I actually wanted to play the scene that would result by her still being here. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The first thing that I spot as my eyes adjust to the light is Charlotte wrangling the kids. She is so busy that she doesn't even notice us arrive.</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker turns to me in surprise. "What's up with the brats?"</p>
		<p>"They're orphans. Lots of kids lost their parents the day of Leviathan, and the days following," I say, unable to keep the sadness out of my voice. I know it is like to lose one parent, and I can't imagine losing them both. "We've taken them in. Charlotte takes care of them."</p>
		<p>"Charlotte?" she asks. She turns to look at the young girl tending to the children. She tilts her head. "She looks familiar."</p>
		<p>"She's our classmate," I reply.</p>
		<p>"No shit?" Shadow Stalker shakes her head. "Does she know about you?"</p>
		<p>I nod, to which she asks, "Does she know about me?"</p>
		<p>I shake my head. "No. I never told anyone."</p>
		<p>She looks at me for a moment before offering a thoughtful, "Huh."</p>
		<p>I release my hand from Shadow Stalker's and she quickly withdraws hers, seemingly discomforted at having forgotten that she was still gripping mine. I cross the room and approach Charlotte.</p>
		<p>"Charlotte, we have a guest," I inform her.</p>
		<p>"Skitter? Sorry, hold on," she mutters distractedly while she tries to free a child from their backpack. "The kids just got back from their classes. It's a bit chaotic."</p>
		<p>I smile behind my mask. "I can see that."</p>
		<p>Behind me Shadow Stalker takes it upon herself to wonder around the room. My lair is three stories high, but the first floor is probably the least impressive. There is a small kitchen, a room with bunk beds reserved for the children, Charlotte, and Sierra, and this room here. The room we're standing in is a large foyer, furnished with a couch and a television placed off to the side. The majority of the room is empty space that leads to the bay doors.</p>
		<p>"What happened here?" Shadow Stalker asks, pointing to a large chunk missing from the concrete wall.</p>
		<p>"Mannequin, this morning," I say and huff a sigh. "I'm so thankful that the kids weren't here."</p>
		<p>"Yeah..," Charlotte agrees in a whisper, as if trying to imagine what could have been. She shakes her head and stands, then points at the entrance. "Speaking of Mannequin, Coil's guys stopped by. I guess Tattletale called him." She indicates the new door standing in place of the one that Mannequin cut off its hinges.</p>
		<p>I nod. Coil is nothing if not efficient. I'm glad that the entrance to our base wasn't left open. I was afraid that I was going to have to board it up for the night.</p>
		<p>Exhausted from the day, I remove my mask and shake out my hair. Shadow Stalker observes me in silence. Even though I've confirmed my identity already, it's probably still a shock to see her bully victim wearing the costume of a nationally known supervillain. Like two strong threads of her life have merged into one and she can't process it. I had a similar internal logic error when I unmasked Sophia by accident during the Endbringer fight, so I can sympathize.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Shadow Stalker take her mask off too? [90] No. She's not comfortable around Charlotte.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I wait for Shadow Stalker to also remove her mask, but it seems that she isn't willing. I shrug and say, "If you're going to stay here, you can't wear your mask all the time, unless you plan on sleeping in your costume."</p>
		<p>She crosses her arms. "I'm not even an official member yet. I'm not revealing my identity just so can give me the boot."</p>
		<p>I roll my eyes. "Half the team already knows who you are, so that hardly matters. As for Charlotte, she is guarding so many secrets of mine that yours doesn't even rate. I pay her well and I treat her well. She's loyal."</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker shrugs with both palms up. Stubborn.</p>
		<p>I sigh. "Fine. Let's at least address the question of membership." I pull my phone from a pouch on my utility belt. "Before I make this call, is this really what you want?"</p>
		<p>Before answering, Shadow Stalker looks about the room. Her eyes follow the children that Charlotte is corraling into the kitchen area for their after-school snacks. One of the older girls has extricated herself from the group and stole a seat on the couch. The girl turns on the television and the noises of a rambunctious cartoon echo throughout the room. </p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker says, finally, "Yeah, I think it is</p>
		<p>[That's it for now. Thanks for reading!] </p>
