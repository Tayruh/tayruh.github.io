		<blockquote>
		  <p>This is a fanon play of Worm. I'll be playing as the story's main character, Skitter. The story takes place in Brockton Bay and begins shortly after Skitter rescues Charlotte from the Merchants, placing it just after the Slaughterhouse Nine has first made their presence known. It's safe to assume the events leading up to this point follow canon, but I may retcon some stuff for fun. The events going forward aren't intended to follow the original story other than fighting the Nine and rescuing Dinah.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>This actual play uses Starforged. The only oracles used are from Starforged, and the only modification made was to create a custom asset to represent Skitter's powers.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Setting up my background vow to <em>Save Dinah</em> (epic).<br>
		  <strong>Swear an Iron Vow:</strong> (+2 heart) [7, 6 vs 4] Miss. The quest begins with a significant obstacle.<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Abandon Hope] Someone is giving up on something?<br>
		  <strong>Descriptor+Focus:</strong> [Grim Obstacle] Coil is making me do something before he'll even consider letting Dinah go.<br>
		  <strong>Character Goal:</strong> [Make an agreement] Coil requests that I enlist the help of The Pure in the fight against the Nine.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>And now the situational vow to <em>Remove the Slaughterhouse Nine</em> (formidable).<br>
		  <strong>Swear an Iron Vow:</strong> (+2 heart) [8, 3 vs 5] Weak hit. Take +1 momentum (3).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>For the local connection I choose <em>Coil</em> (extreme), since he's not a companion but does come to my aid when I need stuff.<br>
		  <strong>Make a Connection:</strong> (+2 heart) [10, 5 vs 5] Miss. The situation worsens somehow.<br>
		  <strong>Pay the Price:</strong> [You are delayed or put at a disadvantage] Coil won't even take my calls until I resolve the initial Dinah task.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>And finally, the trouble in the region. The region being my lair. This will double as the inciting incident.<br>
		  <strong>Settlement Trouble:</strong> [Dangerous Discovery] Something dangerous, but what?<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Serve Home] Someone attacks my employees.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is it Charlotte that's attacked? Otherwise it's Sierra. [24] Yes, it's Charlotte. And I'm going to say that it's Mannequin attacking.<br>
		  <strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Does Mannequin attack near my lair? (Likely) Otherwise they attack in town. [65] They attack near the lair.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Charlotte bursts in through the door to my lair and slams it shut behind her. Seconds later, blades stab through the door from the opposite side. Charlotte screams that it's Mannequin and disappears into the kitchen to hide. I ready my baton and knife.</p>
		<p>The hinges to the door are sheared off and the door collapses to the ground. Mannequin steps inside.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Combat start. <em>Drive Mannequin Away</em> (formidable).<br>
		  <strong>Enter the Fray:</strong> (+2 heart) [6, 6 vs 4] Miss with match. In a bad spot. I start the fight without any bugs prepared.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I wasn't ready for this and I don't have any bugs near me. Mannequin seizes the opportunity and leaps at me with his blades extended.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I attempt to dodge.<br>
		  <strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+2 edge) [2, 10 vs 8] Weak hit. I avoid the full hit, but I suffer -1 health (4).<br>
		  <strong>Endure Harm:</strong> (+4 health) [7, 7 vs 10] Strong hit with match. Take +1 health (5). My armor takes the brunt of it.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I manage to roll out of the way. Mannequin's blade glances off my armor and is unable to penetrate the fabric of my costume. Mannequin follows my trajectory and swings again. I bring my baton up to block. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+1 iron) [10, 3 vs 5] Weak hit. Suffer -1 supply (4). I drop the baton.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I manage to block the blade but the impact is enough to make my hands go numb. I lose grip of the baton and it clatters to the floor.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Mannequin tries to grab my face and I try to duck it.<br>
		  <strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+2 edge) [4, 9 vs 7] Weak hit. I dodge, but I suffer -1 health (4).<br>
		  <strong>Endure Harm:</strong> (+4 health) [2, 8 vs 8] Weak hit. Suffer -1 momentum (2) but take +1 health (5).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Mannequin shoots his arm toward my face, trying to grasp my head in its vice-like grasp. I deflect it at the last second with a backhand and stumble back.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>He tries for the leg with his other hand and I attempt to leap for my baton.<br>
		  <strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+2 edge) [2, 9 vs 4] Weak hit. I grab the baton but he also gets my leg. Suffer -1 health (4).<br>
		  <strong>Endure Harm:</strong> (+4 health) [8, 2 vs 6] Weak hit. I take the hit.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I spot the lost baton and leap for it. Mannequin lashes out with his other hand and grabs me by the ankle. I scream in pain as he lifts me off the ground, my recovered baton gripped tightly in my hand.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm unsure what he's doing in this position.<br>
		  <strong>Combat Action:</strong> [Make a cautious or probing attack] He toys with me.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Holding me upside down about two feet off the ground, Mannequin tilts his head at me like a confused puppy, taunting me. I struggle and swing at him but he's too far away.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Have I recovered enough bugs to attack at this point? (Likely) [71] Yes, I now have bugs at my disposal, so I try to use them to free me.<br>
		  <strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+3 wits, +2 bugs health) [5, 5 vs 7] Strong hit with match. Take +1 momentum (3) and in control.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>With a command, my bugs burst in through every crevice in the room and cover Mannequin. They squeeze their way into gaps in his joints and cover what I assume may be his sensors. He continues to hoist me by my ankle for a moment but inevitably his joints give out and he releases me against his will. I manage to roll into a summersault and recover.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm going to use my bugs to create decoys and draw him away from my lair and Charlotte.<br>
		  <strong>Gain Ground:</strong> (+2 edge, +2 bugs health) [3, 10 vs 8] Weak hit. Mark progress (1). He doesn't chase me as much as I'd like.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>On my feet now, I turn and run, leaving a trail of bug decoys that also run in my direction. Mannequin does not sprint after me, however. He instead stalks slowly and carefully after me. It's unclear whether he is confused by the decoys or not.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to bind him with webbing.<br>
		  <strong>Gain Ground:</strong> (+3 wits, +2 bug health) [5, 2 vs 7] Strong hit. Mark progress (2) and take +1 to next move.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As he exits the doorway, my bugs swarm him. Wasps carrying spiders with web nets surround him. His movement is slowed as the webbing restricts his limbs.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I bind him further.<br>
		  <strong>Gain Ground:</strong> (+3 wits, +1 forward) [2, 4 vs 5] Strong hit. Mark progress (3) and take +2 momentum (5).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I continue wrapping him in webbing, slowing his progress.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>And again..<br>
		  <strong>Gain Ground:</strong> (+3 wits, +2 bug health) [1, 9 vs 10] Strong hit. Mark progress (4) and take +2 momentum (7).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Mannequin staggers under the stress of the webbing.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to ruin his arm joint with my knife.<br>
		  <strong>Strike:</strong> (+1 iron) [7, 6 vs 4] Burn 7 momentum (2) for a weak hit. Mark progress twice (6) but in a bad spot. I ruin his shoulder socket but he counters me.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Out of frustration, I jam my knife into one of his arm sockets. There's a grinding sound and the arm dislodges from the shoulder. It no longer functions under his power but is still held against his body by the webbing. In retaliation, Mannequin opens his mouth and prepares to release his gas.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to get clear of it.<br>
		  <strong>React Under Fire:</strong> (+2 edge) [6, 1 vs 6] Weak hit. Suffer -1 health (3). I choke on the gas a bit.<br>
		  <strong>Endure Harm:</strong> (+3 health) [7, 3 vs 7] Weak hit. Suffer -1 momentum (1) but take +1 health (4).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I launch myself backward. I land just beyond the range of the gas, but not before inhaling a bit of it, and I choke. Fighting dizziness, I throw my knife at his feet and the blade creates a spark, igniting the gas.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Clash:</strong> (+2 edge) [8, 1 vs 8] Weak hit. Mark progress (7) but suffer -1 health (3). The blast hits me as well.<br>
		  <strong>Endure Harm:</strong> (+3 health) [2, 3 vs 6] Strong hit. Take +1 health (4). My armor saves me again.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The blast sends both of us flying. I crash against a dumpster but my armor absorbs most of the impact. I slowly rise to my feet and point my gun at Mannequin.</p>
		<p>"Get the fuck out of my territory," I say.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I'm going to call it. I think that was enough to end the fight.<br>
		  <strong>Take Decisive Action:</strong> (7 progress) [8, 5] Weak hit. [It's worse than you thought] Suffer -2 spirit (3). Remove the <em>Drive Away Mannequin</em> track. Mannequin is driven off but not without shaking my resolve first.<br>
		  <strong>Endure Stress:</strong> (+3 spirit) [1, 6 vs 7] Strong hit. Take +1 spirit (4).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Mannequin picks himself up and stalks toward me, unflinching. He presses his forehead to the barrel of my gun. He tilts his head in a mocking manner, then turns and walks away.</p>
		<p>I slink to the ground, exhausted.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Reach a Milestone:</strong> Mark progress on <em>Remove the Slaughterhouse Nine</em> (1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I return to my lair to check on Charlotte. I find her in the kitchen, huddled in the corner.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is she okay? [10] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Hearten:</strong> [2, 6 vs 8] Strong hit. Take +2 spirit (5). I spend time with Charlotte.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I try to comfort Charlotte. She's really scared. I put an arm around her and she stiffens. She still sees me as the creepy bug girl, it seems.</p>
		<p>I carefully remove my arm from her so as not to spook her, then wander over to the cooking area. "Hey. Can I get you anything? I was going to make myself some tea."</p>
		<p>"… Tea. Tea will be fine," she says and nods as if to confirm it to herself. I nod in response and turn to make the tea.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Make a Connection:</strong> (+2 heart) [8, 9 vs 7] Miss. The situation gets worse somehow.<br>
		  <strong>Combat Action:</strong> [Leverage the advantage of a weapon or ability] Charlotte emphasizes how dangerous this job is.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>After a long moment of silence while I make the tea, Charlotte speaks up. "Skitter, I'm not sure of I can do this job anymore."</p>
		<p>I turn to face her but remain silent.</p>
		<p>She continues, "Mannequin was only after me to get to you, but even so, I nearly died."</p>
		<p>"I won't let that happen," I say.</p>
		<p>"You don't know that. And I wouldn't be the first to die on your watch." After a breath she hurries to add, "No offense. Really. I know you try, but you're still only human."</p>
		<p>I frown behind my mask. She's not wrong, but I try so hard to project an image of being untouchable that it's disheartening when my employees see right through it.</p>
		<p>"Is there anything that I can do to make you more at ease?" I ask.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is there? [18] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Withdraw Honor] She needs to take a step back.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Charlotte explains that she needs some time off. I don't know where she'll be going, but apparently she has some people that she can stay with. I tell her that she can call if she needs anything and she accepts the offer gratefully.</p>
		<p>With that settled, I decide to go see Tattletale to inform her about Mannequin and discuss the Nine.</p>
