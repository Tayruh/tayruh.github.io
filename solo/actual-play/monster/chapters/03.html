		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Cami:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Insecure d10</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Finola:</strong> Remove <em>Intoxicated d6</em> complication. She's definitely sober by now.<br>
		   <strong>Seoyun:</strong> Step down complication to <em>Remarkable d8</em>. Step down complication to <em>Untrustworthy d8</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Seth:</strong> Remove <em>Guilt Material d8</em> complication. Seoyun no longer has anything to hold over me after what she just did to Melody.<br>
		  <strong>Vanessa:</strong> Step down stress to <em>Angry d4</em>.</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> The three of us purchase snack supplies. [9] Scene is as expected.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun, Finola, and I retraced our steps to the front door of the grocery store, and after ensuring that Finola was still tucked away out of sight, we entered the building.</p>
		<p>The Village Market had always felt charming and cozy to me. The store's interior design gave the impression of a ski lodge converted into a food mart, with its floor, support beams, and ceiling styled in simple varnished wood, complimented by walls painted in off-white. All that was missing to complete the decor was a stone fireplace. Overall the small shop felt warm and welcoming, which was also an apt description of its owners.</p>
		<p>To the right of the entrance, Anna Rosenthal worked the cash register from behind the checkout counter. The woman was beautiful, though short-statured, and resembled a matured version of Melody, with chestnut-brown hair like her daughter's, that flowed down her back to her waist. She greeted us with a friendly smile and wave as we passed her, before returning her attention to the short line of customers in front of her.</p>
		<p>I grabbed a small shopping cart and headed toward the chips and crackers aisle with Seoyun in tow.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything interesting happen while we're shopping? (50/50) Otherwise I'll quickly summarize the scene. [74] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Actions: Use Expectation] Melody returns to the shop. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I snagged a bag of chips that I knew to be Erin's favorite and I tossed it into the cart. Finola piped up that she wanted caramel popcorn, so I dropped a bag of that into the cart as well. I turned to ask Seoyun what she would like, and I froze at the sight behind her.</p>
		<p>Melody entered the store from the door in back.</p>
		<p>Seoyun raised an eyebrow at me, but I didn't respond as I watched Melody. The poor girl struggled to close the door. She looked weak and ill. Melody had removed her wig since we last saw her, and her curly hair was a mess, frizzed with static in spots and matted down in others. Her forehead glistened with a sheen of sweat and she wobbled as she stood, as though a gentle breeze could knock her over.</p>
		<p>Seoyun followed my gaze toward the back door, then her eyes brightened and her lips curved into a vulpine grin. "This should be fun." </p>
		<p>I grimaced at her and she happily turned that grin on me.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Melody remember me being there? (50/50) [22][Event Focus: Current Context][Actions: Oppose Possessions] Yes. Melody also takes issue with me being with Seoyun, thinking we're a couple.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It didn't take long before Melody's gaze fell upon me. Her face immediately scrunched up into a scowl. Seoyun kept grinning, like this were the most entertaining thing in the world to her, as Melody stumbled her way toward us on shaky legs.</p>
		<p>I pretended not to notice Melody approaching and returned my focus to shopping.</p>
		<p>Melody slapped her hands down on the low shelving separating us. "You. What did you do to me?"</p>
		<p>I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye as I continued placing items in my cart. "What are you talking about?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Seth:</strong> Begin contest. I feign ignorance. (Never Enough for Father d8, Melody d4, Presence d8) [8, 4, 4] = 12 (d8)</p>
		  <p><strong>Melody:</strong> She tries to read me. (Difficulty 2d8, Sheltered Girl d6, Observant d8) [3, 5, 2, 4] = 8 (d8). Failure. Take <em>Insecure d8</em> stress.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Melody narrowed her eyes as she scrutinized me. "I saw you."</p>
		<p>"Melody." I caught Seoyun's expression in my peripheral as I turned to face Melody. The smug kumiho had toned her grin down to a mere smirk. "You really need to be more specific. You saw me where? Doing what?"</p>
		<p>"In the back!" Melody stomped her foot in frustration, catching the attention of a few shoppers. Melody blushed, then lowered her voice as she continued, "You… uh… I don't know what you did, you pervert, but the last thing I saw was you, and then I woke up on the ground."</p>
		<p>I blinked slowly and just stared at Melody with an expression that said "Are you stupid?" The young girl withered a little under my gaze and looked away.</p>
		<p>Seoyun stepped up and wrapped her arms around me. "Oh, sweetie, I get it. Believe me." She planted a kiss on my cheek with a loud smack of her lips for dramatic effect. "I dream of this hunk 'a man nightly, too."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does this anger Melody? (Likely) Otherwise she's defeated. [87] No. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<del>She bluntly asks me what I did to her.</del><br>

		<p>Melody tells Seoyun that she should stay away from me, but Seoyun uses the situation to tease both Melody and me.</p>
