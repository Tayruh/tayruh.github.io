		<h2 id="encouraged">Encouraged</h2>
		<p>The following are interesting story ideas that may or not may get added to the fiction at some point.</p>
		<h5 id="definites">Definites</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Seth meets his mother.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="maybes">Maybes</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>The mansion has a cavernous basement, like something Batman would have.</li>
		<li>Potential mythogical beings: Frankenstein monster (Jannik?), hellhound, lich, living doll, nightmare, wendigo, doppelganger.</li>
		<li>Potential mythogical weapons: Gram, Durandal, Vorpal Blade.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="expected">Expected</h2>
		<p>The following are questions raised by events and information already present in the fiction that should be answered or resolved.</p>
		<h5 id="definites">Definites</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Where is Walter?</li>
		<li>What does Melody look like? (Describe her better when she's healthy again.)</li>
		<li>How old is Melody?</li>
		<li>What are a "pack" of vampires called?</li>
		<li>Who is Seth's mother?</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="maybes">Maybes</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>What does the mansion look like? (Describe the exterior in the daytime.)</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h2 id="envisioned">Envisioned</h2>
		<p>The following are implied or proposed facts regarding persons, places, and things in the story that are not present in the fiction yet and may change.</p>
		<h5 id="cami">Cami</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>She has no intention of making more vampires.<!-- She finds the stories in which vampires create armies or seethes to be ridiculous, since a vampire would just be creating their own competition for power and food, while increasing the chances of being discovered. It's much more intelligent to remain the only wolf hidden among the sheep. --> </li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="finola">Finola</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>She has taken a liking to Seth and considers him her pet.</li>
		<li>She is about 5.5 inches tall.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="hitomi">Hitomi</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Her long black hair usually covers her face when she's upset.</li>
		<li>She doesn't really sleep or have the need for sleep, but politely dissappears while others sleep.</li>
		<li>She has a habit of appearing out of nowhere, either by appearing when no one is looking, or by crawling out of a TV, mirror, or something similar.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="melody">Melody</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>She's 17 years old.</li>
		<li>She doesn't have many friends because her parents are overprotective.</li>
		<li>She is very inquisitive and keeps getting herself into trouble while trying to uncover the mystery behind me and those that stay at the boardinghouse.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="seoyun">Seoyun</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>She gets upset when someone calls her a dog.</li>
		<li>When she retrieves the fox marble, the victim loses memory of Seoyun leading up to the retrieval for roughly twice as long as the marble had been in their body. The victim will remember events in which Seoyun was involved, just not that she was present. According to the victim's memory, they will have not seen nor heard word of Seoyun during the time of the memory loss, though they will retain full knowledge of her leading up to that period of time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="sera">Sera</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Her birth name is made up of clicks and chirps on arachne language, so she had her friends give her a name.</li>
		<li>She is friendly, excitable, and a bit naive.</li>
		<li>She can cling to surfaces, can make webs, can sense vibrations, and such.</li>
		<li>Rather than actually cling, she more like <em>runs</em> on the ceiling. She has to be gentle to not damage the surface, and if she doesn't sprint, usually her weight will pull part of the ceiling down with her.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="seth">Seth</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>His personal vehicle is a Subaru Imprezza WRX. The mansion has a Jeep Wagoneer for hauling big things, like carting around poor Sera.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="vanessa">Vanessa</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Her  name is unpronounceable in human tongue, so she picked a name that she thought sounded pretty.</li>
		</ul>
		<!--
		##### Walter
		- His first wife and Seth's mother was a nightmare, the mythological being.
		
		-->
		<hr>
		<h2 id="established">Established</h2>
		<p>The following are facts regarding persons, places, and things in the story that are present in the fiction and are concrete.</p>
		<h3 id="persons"><center>Persons</center></h3>
		<h5 id="anna">Anna</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Anna Rosenthal.</li>
		<li>Friendly.</li>
		<li>Beautiful. Short-statured. Waist-length chestnut-brown hair. Resembles a matured version of Melody.</li>
		<li>She is the wife of Thomas and the mother of Melody.</li>
		<li>She owns and runs the Village Market with Thomas.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="cami">Cami</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Princess Camellia Alexandrescu. Romanian.</li>
		<li>Elegant. Haughty. Entitled. Tsundere.</li>
		<li>Appears to be 20 at the most. Waist-length cascading raven-black hair. Glowing green eyes. Porcelain skin.</li>
		<li>Once upon a time, she was a princess. Her kingdom has fallen long ago but she still clings to her royal status, believing that one day her kingdom will rise again.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="eileen">Eileen</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Eileen Kingsley.</li>
		<li>She is the mother of Erin and the second wife of Walter.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="erin">Erin</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Erin Kingsley. English American.</li>
		<li>Spunky. Cheerful and energetic</li>
		<li>17 years old. Shoulder-length mousy brown hair. Honey brown eyes. Short statured.</li>
		<li>She is the younger sister of Seth.</li>
		<li>While her attitude is endearing to most, she often finds that people won't take her seriously.</li>
		<li>She is the daughter of Walter and his second wife, Eileen. She spent the majority of her childhood by her mother's side, and aside from Seth, Eileen is the most important person in her life.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="finola">Finola</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Fionnuala Moonspun. Irish.</li>
		<li>Mischievous.</li>
		<li>Looks about 15 years old. Short messy golden hair. Black eyes. Pointed ears. Insect-like wings. Small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.</li>
		<li>Her body exudes magic with a constant faint golden glow.</li>
		<li>Ornate green and white dress.</li>
		<li>She is a solitary faerie aligning with the autumn side of the Unseelie Court. The Unseelie are considered the dark or chaotic side of the faerie.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="gray">Gray</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>His last name is unknown.</li>
		<li>He uses his fearmongering abilities to scare children, feeding off their fear—and occasionally feeding on the children themselves.</li>
		<li>No one is sure what brought Gray to the mansion or why he continues to reside there.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="hitomi">Hitomi</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Nakamura Hitomi (中村ひとみ). Japanese.</li>
		<li>Shy. Polite. Unstable.</li>
		<li>16 or 17 years old. Waist-length straight silky black hair. Dark brown eyes.</li>
		<li>Always wears Japanese school uniform of navy blue plaid skirt, a similarly colored blazer over a white dress shirt, and a large red bow at her collar. Uniform changes from pristine to ragged, muddy, and bloody, depending on mood.</li>
		<li>She is a classic Japanese ghost of vengeance. She can disappear and reappear in an instant, pass through walls, and instill cardiac-arresting levels of fear.</li>
		<li>She is a shy high school girl that managed to catch the eye of her crush. When she and the boy snuck off to a secluded spot, rather than fulfilling her fantasies, he murdered her for sport and dumped her in a ditch. She was so full of rage at the betrayal that her spirit refused to rest.</li>
		<li>She has issues with big changes or lots of activity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="jess">Jess</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Jessamine Verlaine. French.</li>
		<li>Temperamental. Yandere.</li>
		<li>Appears to be in her early 20s. Chin-length fiery red hair in a bob cut. Sapphire blue eyes that glow when angry.</li>
		<li>She is enthralled to Cami. At least once a week Cami lets her drink of her blood, granting her supernatural abilities, preventing aging, and reinforcing their bond.</li>
		<li>When Cami found her, Jess had been shunned by everyone that she loved and was attempting to take her own life. She had nearly succeeded, but Cami discovered her just in time to pull her back from the clutches of death.</li>
		<li>Although she is close friends with Erin, Jess still puts Cami before their friendship.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="melody">Melody</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Melody Rosenthal.</li>
		<li>Observant. Adventurous. Confident.</li>
		<li>She's the daughter of Thomas and Anna Rosenthal.</li>
		<li>She helps her parents run the Village Market. </li>
		<li>She and Seth know each other since this is a small town and he comes to her shop often.</li>
		<li>She's surprisingly outgoing despite not having a lot of friends.</li>
		<li>She has a crush on Seoyun, and she is very suspicious of Seth.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="seoyun">Seoyun</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Min Seo-yun (민서윤). Korean.</li>
		<li>Charming and seductive. Enigmatic. Cunning.</li>
		<li>Prefers to appear as woman in her early 20s, but can appear to be any age or gender. Long wavy auburn hair. Amber eyes. Typically maintains human form with fox ears and two large, fluffy fox tails.</li>
		<li>She is a fabled Korean nine-tailed fox spirit. Kumiho are foxes in their natural form and transform into beautiful women to lure men, whom they kill by consuming their spirit energy.</li>
		<li>Although she has never been forthcoming about her past, it's apparent that something nasty went down in Korea, and she is trying to hide as far away from there as she can.</li>
		<li>She doesn't get along with Finola very well. She finds her incredibly irritating.</li>
		<li>She has the yeowoo guseul (여우구슬), the fox marble, which she keeps in the back of her throat. She can absorb the spirit energy of a human with a kiss.</li>
		<li>When she siphons only a little spirit energy from someone, it leaves them feeling ill, like a bad flu. It doesn't take long, just the length of an average kiss, which implies that killing someone wouldn't take any time at all either.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="sera">Sera</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Her birth name is made up of clicks and chirps.</li>
		<li>Ditzy.</li>
		<li>She is an arachne. Her upper body is that of a young girl, and conjoins with the body of a large spider starting at her waist. Her body takes up an extraordinary amount of space, but possesses all of the advantages of a spider.</li>
		<li>She's not necessarily dumb, she is easily distracted or confused.</li>
		<li>She was born into a high class family. While she hasn't divulged the reasons, it seems that her parents have disowned and disinherited her.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="seth">Seth</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Seth Kingsley. English American.</li>
		<li>Serious. Driven.</li>
		<li>20 years old. Short black hair. Steel blue eyes. Clean cut. Athletic build.</li>
		<li>He is the older brother of Erin and the son of Walter.</li>
		<li>He takes his position seriously. He does whatever it takes to provide a good life for those in his care.</li>
		<li>He is overprotective of his Erin and now his lodgers.</li>
		<li>No matter how hard he tries, he is never good enough for his father.</li>
		<li>It has been a year since he and his Erin took over the boardinghouse from his Walter.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="thomas">Thomas</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Thomas Rosenthal.</li>
		<li>He is the husband of Anna and the mother of Melody.</li>
		<li>He owns and runs the Village Market with Anna.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="vanessa">Vanessa</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Her true name is unpronounceable in human tongue.</li>
		<li>Prim and proper. Subservient.</li>
		<li>Normally maintains the shape of a demure woman of a woman in her mid-30s. Black hair made of tentacles. Glowing, pupil-less yellow eyes. Pale blue complexion. Slimy skin. Tentacles from waist down.</li>
		<li>Maid uniform of a black dress beneath a white ruffled apron with a matching headdress.</li>
		<li>She is a shoggoth—an amorphous shapeshifting blob of sentient flesh created by the Elder Things to serve as its protector. She can grow into a mass of eyes, teeth, and tentacles larger than a house.</li>
		<li>She has sworn to serve the Kingsley family since Seth's great-grandfather. She serves as both a maid and a protector.</li>
		<li>Because she can't pass for human, she unfortunately always needs Seth or Erin to make grocery trips for her.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="walter">Walter</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Walter Kingsley</li>
		<li>He is the father to Seth and Erin.</li>
		<li>He left the boardinghouse to the care of Seth and Erin one year ago.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3 id="places"><center>Places</center></h3>
		<h5 id="town%20of%20forest%20glen">Town of Forest Glen</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>The town is small, and reminiscent of the ones from Smallville, Gremlins, or Once Upon a Time. It's surrounded by forest, and getting to the next town requires a decent amount of travel on lonely roads through the forest in either direction.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="hidden%20haven%20boardinghouse">Hidden Haven Boardinghouse</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>A boardinghouse for myths, tucked away deep in the forest. There's a long, winding dirt road leading to the town of Forest Glen.</li>
		<li>Walter passed the role of management to Seth and Erin a year ago.</li>
		<li>Vanessa is the only cleaning and cooking staff for the boardinghouse.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 id="village%20market">Village Market</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Charming and cozy. Warm and welcoming.</li>
		<li>Like a ski lodge converted into a food mart. Off-white walls, and varnished wood ceilings, floors, and supports. Checkout counter to right of entrance.</li>
		<li>The shop is a local mom-and-pop grocery store in Forest Glen.</li>
		<li>Owned and run by Thomas and Anna Rosenthal, and assisted by their daughter Melody.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3 id="things"><center>Things</center></h3>
		<h5 id="myths">Myths</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>Myths, or the slang term "monsters," are mythological beings.</li>
		<li>No one is sure which came first, the mythological beings themselves, or the myths describing them, but it was a safe bet that if many people believed in a myth associated with a being that inspired fear, that being is walking the earth somewhere.</li>
		<li>Only a handful of the world's population are aware that myths exist. Seth's family provided a place for the myths to live away from humans.</li>
