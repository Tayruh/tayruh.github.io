<h1 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Traits is something that defines your character, like their mental
ability, or a relationship with a character, or their skill in
mechanics, etc. Trait sets are a collection of traits grouped together
around a common theme (relationships, attribute, skills, etc).</li>
<li>Every character requires a prime set, which is a set of at least two
trait sets that are to be added to your pool along with your distinction
for every roll, giving you a default pool of three dice. Therefore these
prime sets should be broad enough to cover every situation so that they
can logically be included in every roll. From the official trait sets
defined in the handbook, attributes, distinctions, skills, affiliations,
relationships, powers, roles, and values make for the best prime sets.
Other trait sets are useful additions to include along with the prime
sets.</li>
<li>If you extend your trait sets with SFX or statements, do not include
more than 2 of each type in your game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prime-trait-sets">Prime Trait Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliations:</strong> Solo, Buddy, Team; Clergy, Nobility,
Commons. Default rating of D8. Step one down to D6 to step one up to
D10.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility, Alertness, Intelligence,
Strength, Vitality, Willpower. Defaults to D8. Every stepped up die must
have an equally stepped down die--a D12 must be offset by a D4.</li>
<li><strong>Distinctions:</strong> Distinctions are a prime set by
default. You get three distinctions, which are phrases that describe
your character's personality quirks, background, or role in the world.
They all have a value of D8. They all come automatically with the SFX
"Hinder: Switch out for a D4 to earn a PP."</li>
<li><strong>Powers:</strong> Powers generally represent super powers but
can also be gear or special equipment. Each power simply lists what it
can do like "Heat Vision," "Supersonic Flight," and "Lightning Blasts."
A power has a rating of D6 to D12 (minor, enhanced, superhuman, godlike
or influence, control, mastery, supremacy).</li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Relationship with other characters.
One is D8, one is D10, and the rest are D6.</li>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Craft, Drive, Fight, Fix, Fly, Focus,
Influence, Know, Labor, Move, Notice, Operate, Perform, Shoot, Sneak,
Survive, Throw, Treat, Trick. Each skill starts at D4. You get points
equal to 2/3 of your skills (12 points using the default list). Spend
points to step up skill dice (Untrained, Competent, Expert, Master,
Grandmaster).</li>
<li><strong>Values:</strong> Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth;
Envy, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath. One D10, one D8, one
D4, and the rest are D6. When you step up a value in play, you must step
down another value to compensate. Values tend to have trait statements
to describe the character's view regarding that value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supporting-trait-sets">Supporting Trait Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> There are four kinds: extras, locations,
organizations, and props. A resource is valuable but expendedable or of
limited use. A resource is multiples the same die rating, usually D6. It
comes with a name and two tags to describe its area of use, like "Cortez
City Police Department: Investigation, Law".</li>
<li><strong>Signature Assets:</strong> Assets that belong to a
character. They start as a D6. They can come with up to 3 SFX.</li>
<li><strong>Talents:</strong> Like a distinction, talents come with a
unique name and an SFX. They do not have an associated die rating.
Compared to standard SFX, talents come with a complex activation and
effect. Also unlike standard SFX, the conditions are not always based on
something in your control and do not require any negative conditions as
a balance and are only positive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sfx">SFX</h3>
<ul>
<li>SFX are special abilities added to a trait that generate mechanic
effects when conditions are met, either through external forces or by
character action.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>The Exchange:</em> Step up or double one useful die for the
scene but step down one other die in exchange until you do a recovery
action.</li>
<li><em>The Price:</em> Step up or double one useful die for the scene
or take a D8 asset for the scene (choose one benefit here, not both),
but also take a D8 complication.</li>
<li><em>The Swap:</em> Spend a PP to use a different die than would
normally be appropriate for a given action, based on your
distinction.</li>
<li><em>The Edit:</em> Spend a PP to declare a beneficial thing to be
true in the fiction, based on your distinction.</li>
<li><em>The Folly:</em> Earn a PP when you choose to do something
detrimental related to the distinction.</li>
<li><em>The Shutdown:</em> Earn a PP when you declare that, due to
appropriate circumstanhces based on your distinction, you have lost
access to one or more of your attributes/skills/ roles/etc. for the
scene and cannot use it for any actions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spend a PP (very common)</li>
<li>Step down a beneficial die (usually an attribute, skill, or
asset)</li>
<li>Step up a non-beneficial die (usually a complication)</li>
<li>Choose to do or introduce something risky/ill-advised/complicated
(“When you walk right into a volatile situation and start causing
trouble…”)</li>
<li>Create a D8 complication</li>
<li>Shut down a trait set (the trait set can’t be used until
restored)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Earn a PP</li>
<li>Add a D6 to the dice pool</li>
<li>Step up a beneficial die (usually a specialty or asset, like “step
up Pistols”)</li>
<li>Double a beneficial die (usually a specialty or asset, like “double
Pistols”)</li>
<li>Step down a non-beneficial die (usually a complication)</li>
<li>Introduce a non-mechanical story detail (“Hey, I think I know that
guy’s brother...”)</li>
<li>Rename a complication (“I’m not Sickened, I’m Angry”)</li>
<li>Reroll a single die</li>
<li>Create a D8 asset for the rest of the scene</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-traits">Optional Traits</h2>
<h3 id="rated-distinctions">Rated Distinctions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distinctions are normally always a set of three at D8. However, you
can also opt to have a number of them with each rated from D4 to D12,
but the average should still be D8.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="highlighting-of-traits">Highlighting of Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>This comes from Firefly.</li>
<li>When assigning distinctions, decide which two traits from a specific
trait set (like skills or powers) each highlight. For example, "Soldier
of Fortune" would highlight "Shoot" and "Survive". When assigning those
traits, they get stepped up by one for each distinction that highlights
it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>This comes from Leverage.</li>
<li>As opposed to skills that focus on a specific task, roles focus on
areas of expertise. It is assumed that the character is able to perform
all tasks that fall within that field of expertise at the proficiency
level of the die rating associated with it.</li>
<li>Examples of roles are Commander, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and
Soldier. Or Warrior, Priest, Wizard, Rogue, and Bard. Or Crowd Control,
Medical Emergency, Legal Specialist, Network Specialist, Tactical
Response, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-sets">Power Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li>This comes from Marvel Heroic RPG.</li>
<li>A power set is a collection of powers united under a common theme.
Each power set counts as its own trait set. Power sets comes with at
least one limit, at least one SFX, and a single source of its
theme.</li>
<li>Limits generally come in the flavor of rewarding a PP in exchange
for shutting down this power set. Shutting down a power set means that
its power traits and SFX cannot be used until the conditions to restore
the power are met.</li>
<li>Other options for limits are to shutdown one power to activate
another so that they alternate (for example, Emma Frost with her
telepathy or diamond form). Regardless, it should come with some limit
that presents some negative side to the power set.</li>
<li>There's no set number of powers in a set but there's usually at
least two. There is also no cap for die ratings, but it's suggested to
not have more than one trait at D10 or D12.</li>
<li>Since each power set counts as its own trait set, you may include
one die from each power set at no cost of you have more than one.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terran Mysticism</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sorcery D8</li>
<li>Transmutation D10</li>
<li>SFX: <em>Call of Old Earth:</em> Add a D6 and step up your effect
die by one when using "Transmutation" to create assets.</li>
<li>SFX: <em>Thread of Life:</em> Add "Sorcery" to your dice pool when
helping others recover their stress or complications. Spend a PP to
recover your own or another’s physical-based stress or
complications.</li>
<li>Limit: <em>The Old Power:</em> When using a "Terran Mysticism"
power, both 1s and 2s count as hitches.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>This comes from Smallville.</li>
<li>An ability is similar to a power with its own SFX. It may seem
similar to a distinction, but it does not come with a default hinder
SFX.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Siren's Song D10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spend a PP to use this as an area effect.</li>
<li>Gain a PP when you attract the wrong sort of attention from your
song.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specialties">Specialties</h3>
<ul>
<li>From Firefly and Marvel Heroic RPG.</li>
<li>Specialties represent areas of knowledge or skill that the character
excels at.</li>
<li>When used alongside skills, specialties add a D6 to their dice pool
whenever that knowledge or skill comes into play. For example, if you
have the specialty of "Guns", it would not only be added when using the
"Shoot" skill, but also when using "Fix" on a cannon or "Know" to
determine the caliber of a bullet.</li>
<li>Another method is to split skills and specialities. For example, if
you have "Shoot D6" and "Gun D10", you would use the D10 in place of the
D6 when using guns, rather than adding both to the dice pool. This is
how it was done in Cortex Classic.</li>
<li>When using specialities with skills, "Know" is given one specialty
for free.</li>
<li>If you choose not to use skills, specialties perform the roll of
skills in their stead. However, unlike how skills give a default of D4
when attempting to use a skill that you don't possess, you are unable to
use any specialty that you do not have. Specialties used this way are
rated D8 through D12.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="playing">Playing</h1>
<h2 id="rolling-dice">Rolling Dice</h2>
<h3 id="dice-pool">Dice Pool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick one die from both of your prime trait sets and your distinction
to form a minimum dice pool of 3. You may add an additional die from
each remaining trait set as long as the trait is relevant.</li>
<li>You may add more than one trait from a set at the cost of 1 PP for
every additional.</li>
<li>An asset is not a trait, and thus as many assets can be used as are
applicable to the situation at no cost.</li>
<li>Sum 2 dice from your rolled pool as your total and keep another as
your effect die. Hitches can't be used as part of your total. (See
"effect die" below for eligible effect dice.)</li>
<li>Dice from a resource pool are commited before the roll and rolled
separately from your main dice pool. The highest rolled die of all
commited resource dice is kept and added to the total of your dice pool
roll.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="effect-die">Effect Die</h3>
<ul>
<li>The effect die represents how effective your action was.</li>
<li>From your rolled pool, pick one die as your effect die--the roll
doesn't matter, only the die size. When your roll beats your opposition,
the effect die will be inflicted upon the opposition as a
complication.</li>
<li>Your die can't be a hitch or a die added by spending PP. If no
eligible die remains, the effect die is always a D4.</li>
<li>If any SFX rule steps up an effect die beyond D12, either the
opposition is taken out or another unused die from your pool is added as
a second effect die. If there are no eligible dice remaining for a
second effect die, a D4 is used instead.</li>
<li>When a test or contest isn't opposed and you need an effect die, you
pick the largest die size in the pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heroic-success">Heroic Success</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beat the difficulty by 5 or more. Step up the effect die for every 5
points over the difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hitch">Hitch</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a die comes up as a 1. It can't be used towards the total or as
an effect die. The GM may activate it to give you a complication in
exchange for a Plot Point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="botch">Botch</h3>
<ul>
<li>When all dice come up 1's. Really bad stuff happens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-and-contests">Test and Contests</h2>
<h3 id="contests">Contests</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roll your dice pool to set a total to beat. If the opposition
refused to oppose you, you immediately get what you want and that's it
(they do not earn a PP as no actual contest has been had). If they roll
and beat your score, their score is the new value to beat.</li>
<li>If you choose...
<ul>
<li>...not to oppose them, you get a PP and get to describe your failure
on your own terms and can't immediately initiate a contest with that
opponent.</li>
<li>...to roll against their score and beat it, that score is the new
value and the opponent now must choose whether to oppose you. This back
and forth with ever-increasing scores continues until someone fails to
beat the opposition or gives in.</li>
<li>...to roll against their score and fail, they get to describe how
they stopped you. You get a complication equal to the opponent's effect
die. If this is a high stakes game and the opposition's effect die is
larger than your own, you are taken out. You can avoid being taken out
if you spend a PP, but you still get a complication.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interfering-with-a-contest">Interfering with a Contest</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must spend a PP to interfere.</li>
<li>If you lose, you're given a complication and are ejected from the
contest. You may spend another PP to interfere again.</li>
<li>If you win, the contest is effectively over. Anyone that wishes to
continue the contest despite your interference must pay you a PP to
start the contest anew.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timed-tests">Timed Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>A timed test lasts for a number of beats with a determined by the GM
and a difficulty (2D8 for example) set by the GM. The PCs must pass a
number of tests before you run out of beats. Generally the number of
beats matches the number of tests, but the GM can allot more beats for
an easier times test or less for a more difficult one.</li>
<li>If you pass a test, you take a step toward progress. If you fail the
test, you don't. You lose a beat in each case unless you pass the test
with a heroic success (5 over the difficulty). If you failed the test,
you lose an additional beat. Move on to the next stage of test
regardless of the outcome.</li>
<li>Other players may attempt to add beats by passing tests to create a
distraction and such. If they pass the test, they add one beat, or two
with a heroic success. Failing the test means that the PC is no longer
able to help for that timed test.</li>
<li>Timed tests are a race against the clock and even if you fail to
accomplish your goal in time, the character may have accomplished the
goal in the narrative but with a serious complication. If the PC manages
to accomplish their goal by beating the tests but has zero beats left,
the player must choose between accomplishing their goal with a
complication or not accomplishing their goal but getting away
clean.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stress-and-complications">Stress and Complications</h2>
<h3 id="complications">Complications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only one complication should apply to a specific hindrance or
problem. If you need that complication to increase in effect, it should
be stepped up rather than having a second complication created.</li>
<li>When you pay a PP to avoid being taken out, you take a complication
rated the size of the effect die. If there is a related complication
with a die rated higher than the effect die, step the complication up by
one.</li>
<li>Removing a major complication requires rolling against 2D8 and the
complication die. If you beat the roll, eliminate the complication if
your effect die is larger than the complication die rating, and step it
down if it's equal or smaller. If you fail, step up the complication for
each rolled hitch, otherwise the complication remains unchanged.</li>
<li>When a complication has been stepped down to a D4, you may add it to
the next roll in which it would hinder you. Earn a PP for the hindrance
and then eliminate the complication. However, if a hitch is rolled, the
complication may be stepped up instead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the GM rolls a hitch, it's called an opportunity. Players can
purchase this opportunity for a PP to step down an existing complication
or step down a complication, or remove a D4 completely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="taken-out-and-recovering">Taken out and Recovering</h3>
<ul>
<li>A complication stepped up beyond D12 automatically takes you out of
a scene.</li>
<li>If you recover during the same scene in which you were taken out,
you usually return with at least a D6 complication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="character-resources">Character Resources</h2>
<h3 id="traits-1">Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may only add one trait from a set to your dice pool. An
additional trait from a set costs a PP. Some games may only allow using
PP to add extra dice from specific sets, like skills or attributes.</li>
<li>You may gain a temporary trait (like an asset or complication) that
only last as long circumstances allow, such as "Flaming Torch D6". These
traits can also be added to scenes or locations.</li>
<li>If a trait has a trait statement and you act contrary to that
statement, you may triple that die and add it to your pool. After the
roll that trait is stepped down by one. In order to return the die to
its original rating, you must rewrite the trait statement at the end of
the session.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can create a named D6 asset for 1 PP.</li>
<li>Some SFX create assets that are D8 or more, and these are called
stunts.</li>
<li>You may make an asset larger than a D6 or D8 by rolling against a GM
set difficulty, even if the PC has run out of PP.</li>
<li>If a player wants to borrow another player's signature asset, they
must spend a PP to create a new asset as usual.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other traits, resources are a pool of dice that are
expendable. Resource dice commited to a dice roll are removed from that
resource pool.</li>
<li>Resources recover at the start of each session or after a period of
in-game downtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plot-points">Plot Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>You always begin a session with at least 1 PP. Unspent PP are
carried from session to session.</li>
<li>You earn PP through the GM activating a hitch, rewarded for
roleplaying, giving in to a contest, rewarded by certain SFX (such as
Hinder that's attached to all distinctions), or using a non-required D4
in your roll. When the GM decides to purchase a hitch, they only need to
reward 1 PP even though each additional hitch steps up the
complication.</li>
<li>You may spend PP to activate an SFX, add more dice, activate an
opportunity, create a relationship, create a temporary asset, include
more results, interfere in a contest, keep an extra effect die, share an
asset, and stay in the fight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The GM has two pools of PP: the bank and the pile.
<ul>
<li><em>Bank:</em> At the start of each session the GM gets 1 PP per PC
that they can use to assist their GMCs. The bank is shared between GMCs.
When the GM spends a PP from the bank, it goes into the pile.</li>
<li><em>Pile:</em> The pile is an unlimited number of PP that the GM
uses to give to the PCs when purchasing complications on rolled hitches,
when SFX rewards a PP, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The GM may spend PP on their GMCs to include more results, activate
an SFX, or avoid being taken out. When the GM spends a PP to prevent a
GMC from being taken out, the PP goes to the PC in the contest.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gmcs">GMCs</h1>
<h3 id="major-gmc">Major GMC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major GMCs have three power levels: light, medium, and heavy. Light
is the norm; medium is on par with the PCs and should be used sparingly;
heavy should be extremely rare and represent unique threats and
obstacles.</li>
<li><strong>Light:</strong> Prime set ratings are a die step behind the
PCs. The GMCs also have about half as many points in traits like skills,
signature assets, and resources as PCs do.</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Same as PCs.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy:</strong> Basically the same as PCs except one or more
die ratings is a step ahead. 50% more die steps and points in
traits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-gmc">Minor GMC</h3>
<ul>
<li>A minor GMC are named and get at least three traits in anything with
a die rating attached to it.</li>
<li>You may also choose to flesh a minor GMC with the same prime traits
sets as the PCs but not much else.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old Bill</strong>
<ul>
<li>Corrupt Lawman D8</li>
<li>Out of Shape D4</li>
<li>Big Shotgun D8</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Locations can have their own distinctions with SFX just like they
were characters. Any player that can justify using the distinction can
add it to their dice pool.</li>
<li>Locations may also be part of a character file as a resources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panicked Crowd D8</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Hide in the Chaos:</em> Spend a PP to create a "Hidden D8" asset
and turn "Panicked Crowd D8" into "Panicked Crowd 2D6".</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extras">Extras</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extras an unnamed characters with a single die rating represent
them, like "Hired Assassin D10" or "Cut-Rate Thief D6".</li>
<li>You may add additional traits during play as needed and eventually
upgrade them to a minor GMC.</li>
<li>Extras may also be part of a character file as a resource.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobs">Mobs</h3>
<ul>
<li>A mob is a group of extras. Like extras, they are represented by a
single die for each GMC. The die ratings are the same for each mob
member.</li>
<li>Die count represents an abstract size as opposed to representing
invidivual members. The scale is 2: handful of people, 3: a dozen, 4: a
room full of people, 5: a large crowd.</li>
<li>Likewise the die rating represents the general skill level of the
mob. The scale is D6: rabble or thugs, D8: trained guards or soldiers,
D10: elites or veterans.</li>
<li>The mob group itself also comes with a few rated traits like minor
GMCs do. These traits are shared among the mob members, representing the
fact that GMCs are generic and indistinct.</li>
<li>When the mob rolls, all dice representing the extras is added to the
dice pool. For example, if you have a mob of "Pitch-Fork Weilding
Villagers 5D6", all five D6s get added to the pool.</li>
<li>When you attack the mob and create or step up a complication that's
at least the size of the mob's die rating, a member is defeated and the
mob dice count is reduced by one. The complication is then removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goblin Repair Team 3D8</strong>
<ul>
<li>Engineering D8</li>
<li>Stabbing D8</li>
<li>Fleeing D10</li>
<li>Rowdy D6</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bosses">Bosses</h3>
<ul>
<li>A boss is just like a mob except it refers to a single character or
obstacle. Instead of the die count representing multiple members, it
represents the amount of hits the boss can take before getting taken
out.</li>
<li>Unlike a mob, the boss can be more fleshed out and have as many
traits or trait sets detailed as you like, even going so far as being
detailed as a PC in the same that a major GMC is.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factions-and-orgs">Factions and Orgs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Factions and orgs are also mob's but they represent something on a
much larger scale than the PCs.</li>
<li>Factions use a scale die, which basically means that they keep a
third die to sum in their dice roll total unless their opposition has a
scale die rated at least as high as their own.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antagonist PAC 3D10 @D8</strong>
<ul>
<li>Economics D10</li>
<li>Bureaucracy D8</li>
<li>Wealth D10</li>
<li><em>Smear Campaign:</em> Add a D6 and step up "Antagonist PAC"’s
effect die when targeting individuals in public life with rumors,
gossip, or lies.</li>
<li><em>Back Again:</em> When "Antagonist PAC" is reduced to a single
die, it’s taken out. Recover all dice and return to activity in the next
session when a PC rolls a hitch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="crisis-pool">Crisis Pool</h3>
<ul>
<li>This comes from Hammerheads.</li>
<li>Just like a mob, you can create a pool of dice that represent a
crisis that must be overcome, like "Forest Fire 4D6".</li>
<li>Following the same mob rules, if you create or step up a
complication on the crisis beyond its die rating, eliminate one
die.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="errata">Errata</h1>
<h2 id="odds">Odds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using a pool of 2D6 + 2D8 vs 3D6

<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Die Sizes:</strong> Classic uses d2's along with d4
through d12. You can also go above a d12 using d12+d2 and such, which
works because you add all dice together.</li>
<li><strong>Classic Plot Points:</strong> PP in Classic is used
differently than Plus or Prime.
<ul>
<li>You start each session with 6 PP and can hold a max of 12 PP. PP
should be handed out much more freely than in Plus/Prime.</li>
<li>You are allowed to purchase die to add to your total like in
Plus/Prime, but it costs 1 PP for each Step starting at d2. A die added
through this method cannot roll less than its cost (ie. a roll less than
4 on a d8 will be considered a 4).</li>
<li>After a roll, you may also spend PP to increase your total by
purchasing points at the cost of 1 PP each point.</li>
<li>You may also purchase die to reduce damage taken at the point that
it's inflicted. Purchase the die in the same manner as when improving
your roll and then reduce the damage by the rolled amount.</li>
