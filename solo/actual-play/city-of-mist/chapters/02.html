		<h2 id="chapter%202">Chapter 2</h2>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Enkidu visits the morgue. [1] Random Event. [PC Positive: Punish Burden] The beat cops from earlier get chastised.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu parked her vehicle in the secured police station parking lot and got out into pouring rain. She crossed the lot, only to meet the two problem cops from earlier, Kaminsky and Patel, standing on the steps leading into the station. They were conveniently standing under an overhang that kept them dry while Enkidu continued to get soaked.</p>
		<p>Enkidu tried to push past them but they stood in her way, pretending not to notice her while they smoked their cigarettes.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu tries to get them to move.<br>
		  <strong>Convince:</strong> (police work / corruption everywhere) [1, 4] + 0 = 5. Miss. Give <em>pissed-off-2</em> status to Enkidu.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu demanded that they move since she has work to do, but they refused to move aside. Instead they continued chatting with each other like Enkidu wasn't even there. She ran out of patience and screamed at them, threatening to put a bullet in them if they don't move out of her goddamn way.</p>
		<p>The commotion drew the attention of those inside and someone came to check. That someone was her superior, Captain Sheehan. "What's going on here?" she asked.</p>
		<p>Enkidu replied through gritted teeth, "Captain, these two bastards are blocking my way and I have work to do."</p>
		<p>The captain turned to the men and they shrugged. "Sorry, Cap'n. We didn't see her."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure," Captain Sheehan said dryly. "If you two have time to waste smoking out here, then you have time to help the others. Detective Heith could use some assistance filing his paperwork. Go help."</p>
		<p>They both grumbled a "yes, ma'am," then stubbed out their cigarettes and headed into the building.</p>
		<p>Enkidu thanked the captain as she ducked beneath overhang, though she was already soaked all the way through.</p>
		<p>The captain took in Enkidu's soaked appearance and frowned. "I apologize for Kaminsky and Patel. They're an ongoing problem."</p>
		<p>"Captain, I have been working Miller's Square from this precinct for years and I'm sick to death of all the bad cops," Enkidu said angrily. "You need to fire those assholes. Or at the very least have Internal Affairs investigate them. Everyone knows they're dirty."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu tries to get her to do something about the two cops.<br>
		  <strong>Convince:</strong> (police badge, streets of miller's square, you're in my jurisdiction / pissed-off-2) [6, 3] + 1 = 10. Give <em>annoyed-1</em> as the stick, which she takes instead of giving in.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Captain Sheehan crossed her arms and scowled. "Detective Enkidu, you overstep your bounds. This is my department and I will not abide by anyone telling me how it should be run. Furthermore, we may have a few bad apples in our precinct, but I will not tolerate anyone labeling our officers as dirty. Is that clear?"</p>
		<p>Eniku narrowed her eyes. "Yes, ma'am."</p>
		<p>"Good. Be on your way then."</p>
		<p>Having depleted any good will that the captain had toward her, Enkidu decided to take her leave and make her way to the morgue.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Characters:</strong> Add <em>Officers Kaminsky and Patel</em> and <em>Captain Sheehan</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Increase to 6.<br>
		  <strong>Thread Progress:</strong> Mark 2 on <em>Police Corruption</em> (2).</p>
		  <p><strong>Expected Scene:</strong> Enkidu questions the coroner. [1] Random Event. [NPC Negative: Observe Location] The coroner gets caught with her hand in the cookie jar.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Enkidu stomped through the halls of the precinct until she stood before the morgue. She was still angered by the two sorry excuses for cops and the resulting dismissal by her boss. She closed her eyes and took in slow breaths in an attempt to regain her composure. She just needed to get through the next conversation and then she could return to what she actually enjoyedâ€”working the case.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu focuses on her work to calm down.<br>
		  <strong>Change the Game:</strong> (police work) [6, 6] + 1 = 13. Take 2 juice with <em>focus on police work</em> as method.<br>
		  <strong>Spend Juice:</strong> Spend 2 juice (0) to remove <em>pissed-off-2</em> status.</p>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Is the coroner making a phone call? (50/50) Otherwise she steals something. [3] Exceptional yes. It's more than just a business call.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the coroner like? [Powerless / Gentle] Soft-spoken and a bit of a pushover.</p>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is her name? [Va / Nee / Ick] Vanec.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> How do they look? [Tattoo / Clean] Presentable but tatted.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What do the tattoos look like? [Mysteriously Messy] Indecipherable art.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Having found her center, Enkidu braced herself and entered the morgue.</p>
		<p>Coroner Annie Vanec stood across the room with her back to the door. The young woman was well-groomed with hair trimmed into a bob and a manicure decorated with pink nail polish. In contrast, the tattoos that ran up and down her arms were a jumbled collection of images, of which Enkidu couldn't make heads nor tails.</p>
		<p>Vanec was engrossed in a phone call, during which she assured the listener multiple times that she wouldn't say anything and pleaded with them to trust her. After a desperate back and forth, Vanec apparently managed to pacify them and she hung up with an "I love you." The coroner dropped her head and shoulders, and sighed.</p>
		<p>Enkidu cleared her throat and Vanec nearly jumped through the ceiling. She asked if Vanec was alright.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Vanec open up? (Unlikely) [56] No.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The coroner tried to play it off, but she wasn't a very good liar. Enkidu pretended to believe her anyway. She asked the coroner what she found, and her report was much as she expected: there were lacerations on the body from crashing through the glass canopy, but the cause of death was from the impact with the pavement.</p>
		<p>"Is that all you could find on the body?" Enkidu asked.</p>
		<p>"Yep, that's it!" Vanec replied so quickly that she practically spoke over Enkidu's last word.</p>
		<p>Enkidu narrowed her eyes in suspicion. "Show me the body, Annie."</p>
		<p>Vanec hesitated, staring at the detective like a deer caught in headlights. Enkidu tilted her head, waiting for a response. Without saying a word, Vanec moved with a sense of dread toward the collection of morgue drawers set into the wall, as though she was asked to reveal a secret shame, and pulled out the stainless steel slab holding the body. Enkidu gave Vanec a quizzical look before turning to the body.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Enkidu asks the coroner for more details about the body.<br>
		  <strong>Investigate:</strong> (police work, search for evidence, you're in my jurisdiction / my-lips-are-sealed-3) [1, 6] + 0 = 7. Take 1 clue with <em>ask about body//coroner</em> as method and source. Vanec gets to ask a question.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The body was exactly as expected. The woman looked the same as before, but now nude and dry. Her beautiful body was marred by the cuts and lacerations from the glass. Her face was scraped from the impact with the concrete. If anything, she was in remarkable condition considering the distance that she fell.</p>
		<p>Enkidu's eyes caught on markings on her wrists.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Spend Clue:</strong> Ask about the marks. (0) It looks like she was restrained.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The detective asked the coroner about the markings. The coroner pretends to be disinterested and not notice, but it was clear that she was avoiding the topic.</p>
		<p>"Annie," Enkidu said firmly, calling her to attention. "Explain these marks on her wrist."</p>
		<p>"Uh, those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?" Vanec's eyes kept looking to the door like she wanted to run away. "Yeah, I must have missed that."</p>
		<p>Enkidu let out an exasperated sigh. "What would cause these marks around her wrist? Was she bound?"</p>
		<p>"N-no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They, uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Vanec squeezed her eyes shut tight. After a moment, she opened them and then sighed, resigned. She took a step toward the body and asked,  "You see these lighter marks here?" She pointed at the faint marks just below the dark purple ring around the woman's wrists. "These are finger imprints. She was held."</p>
		<p>Enkidu's eyes widened. "It looks like they damn near broke her wrists. How strong would they have to be to do that?"</p>
		<p>Vanec shrugged with her palms up. "Pretty darn strong."</p>
		<p>Looking over the body, Ekidu asked, "<em>Now</em> is that everything?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," the coroner replied, frowning.</p>
		<p>"Good. Make sure those wrist marks make it into the report."</p>
		<p>Vanec nodded and reached for her clipboard.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> What does Vanec ask? [Guide Goal] She asks about Enkidu's partners.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As Enkidu was about to turn away, Vanec looked up from her clipboard. "Detective Enkidu?"</p>
		<p>"Hmm?"</p>
		<p>"I hear that your partners in the private eye business are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unique. A teenager and a socialite? Why them?"</p>
		<p>"We share a desire to help the city." She shrugged one shoulder. "And since they're doing community work, Scarlet gets school credit and Excalibur gets a tax write-off. There's no big mystery."</p>
		<p>"Ah," she replied, embarrassed.</p>
		<p>With nothing further to add, the detective turned and walked toward the exit. She stopped at the door and rested her hand on the knob. "Annie," she said over her shoulder. "<em>Stay. Clean.</em>"</p>
		<p>Vanec sucked in a breath. "Y-yes, ma'am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
		<p>Enkidu turned the knob and exited the morgue.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Characters:</strong> Add <em>Coroner Annie Vanec</em>.<br>
		  <strong>Chaos Factor:</strong> Decrease to 5.</p>
