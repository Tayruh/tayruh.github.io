# Story Setup

When you begin a new story, start by answering these questions to create a strong narrative backbone.

- **Premise:** What is the initial concept and expectation of this story, and what do you find engaging about it?  
	*Be honest about the reasons for wanting to use this premise—include embarrassing reasons and exclude reasons of obligation.*

+ **Problem:** What past event still follows the character, and how does it directly influence their actions or environment in a way that threatens to make their life untenable?  
	*The event doesn't need to be one that the character was involved in, but it must currently affect them. It's okay if the description of the past event is vague, but it should be clear in how its influence will likely unravel the character's life unless it is addressed.*

- **Catalyst:** What new event prevents the character from returning to life as normal, and how does it achieve that?  
	*Event examples are: entering a new world (literally or figuratively), a mystery, a desire for personal growth, or disruption by outside forces.*

+ **Conflict:** What does the hero hope to accomplish, and what is stopping them?  
	*The goal refers to what the hero intends to do within the scope of this setup (story, arc, scene), not their overall goal in life. This goal must be achievable with a definitive stopping point.*

- **Stakes:** What does the hero risk in striving for their goal, and what would they risk by doing nothing?  
	*Low stakes for not acting are boring and deprive the character of motivation. It's expected that there be little to no risk for acting (low risk, high reward) when the story, arc, or scene starts, but it should increase to heights comparable to the risk of not acting (high risk, high reward) as it reaches the climax.*

+ **Urgency:** How long does the character have to achieve their goal, and is the deadline something that can be postponed or eliminated?  
	*Regardless of how high the risk for not acting is, there is no tension without an impending deadline. Likewise, the tension increases dramatically as the deadline draws closer and the risk for acting increase.*

# Story Tips

- The main character must be the one with the most to lose.

+ The main character must be proactive, not reactive.

- Characters are balanced by things that make them cool and things that make them flawed. Regardless of hardship, coolness can only be effectively balanced against flaws. Coolness may overcome flaws during the climax, but never before that.

+ To make dialogue style unique for each character, consider the following scales: Verbose vs terse. Casual vs formal. Spontaneous, planned, or rehearsed.

- If a conflict arises that is bigger than the main conflict, raise the stakes of the main conflict to match.

+ When crafting description, present the broad strokes first, details second.

- Scenes are about action. They can start shortly before the action (build-up/tense), during the action (in media res/frantic), or shortly after the action (mystery/confusing).

# Reactions

Reactions can be used to determine character actions without rolling, or to help assign probabilities when you would like to leave the actions up to chance.

The options for reactions are _always_, _never_, and _when_.

**always:** The character will always attempt to do this in every situation where it's applicable.

**never:** The character absolutely refuses to do this.

**when:** When a certain event happens, it triggers a response. This doesn't have to be a guarantee; you can add a check for it by rolling a d6, or maybe assign more than one option to a d6. You can also use emotional states as part of—or all of—the reaction, or alter the resulting event based on the current emotion.

The following are emotional states: Afraid, Angry, Anxious, Aroused, Ashamed, Calm, Disgusted, Happy, Sad

Here are a couple examples of characters with reactions:

- **Sarah**
	- always *takes the lead in a project*
	- never *trusts her clients*
	- when *Chelsea doesn't take her seriously*, she becomes angry
	- when *confronted with the topic of religion*, she becomes anxious (if happy or calm) or angry (if sad or afraid)

+ **Chelsea**
	- always *tries to get her way*
	- never *worries about money*
	- when *work and play conflict*, play always wins
	- when *Sarah is in leader mode*, she is fine with deferring all decision making to her
	- when *someone is an obstacle*, she:
		- tries to use her sex appeal to convince them: (1-3)
		- tries to blackmail them: (4)
		- tries to convince someone else to threaten them: (5-6)

You can also play around with things that are beyond their control. For example: 
* when *already running late for work*, the chance of losing their car keys is: (1-4)
