<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The story takes place in the 19th century. The character is a vampire
and must lead a young student to the coven. The character finds the
child at the scene of a bloodbath and convinces them that they can lead
them to safety. The character is completing this task because of an
agreement that they made in the past.</p>

<li><del>Why is Katherine special?</del></li>
<li><del>Who sent Vincent on the mission to retrieve
Katherine?</del></li>
<li><del>Who else is after Katherine?</del> Is her parents death related
to this?</li>
<li>Katherine is a bit touched. She doesn't really care that everyone in
the church was slaughtered and she is mostly upset at Vincent out of
being inconvenienced. She even takes kindly to being carried away.</li>
<li>Vincent's vampire coven tends to move around, but it's currently
based under a holiday themed shop. It's nearly Christmas so that's the
current theme.</li>
<li>It's safe to assume that Vanessa knows about her relation to
Katherine, but why does she want her?</li>
<li>Why did Corinna find Katherine's existence to be hilarious?</li>
<li>Charlotte, Corinna, and Margaret have a history. What is it and why
did Corinna call Margaret "betrayer"?</li>
<li>I need to add at least one guy other than Vincent.</li>
