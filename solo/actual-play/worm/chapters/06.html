		<h2 id="chapter%206">Chapter 6</h2>
		<p>The call with Coil had gone exactly as we expected—he agreed to take on Shadow Stalker but refused her a territory, meaning that she would be bunking with me, and he encouraged our meeting with the heroes in place of The Pure. He would have preferred to make this an all-villain affair, but the situation requires compromise.</p>
		<p>The night had passed without excitement, and even Shadow Stalker was being surprisingly cooperative while we figured out the rooming situation. In the end, I split my floor in two and gave her the other side. The second floor of the lair was reserved for "Taylor," and as such my sleeping quarters and personal workspace took up the entire floor, so I had plenty of space to spare. The third floor remains fully dedicated to "Skitter" and my bugs.</p>
		<p>Early this morning Tattletale got a message through to the heroes and requested a meeting.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Where does the meeting with the heroes take place?<br>
		  <strong>Oracle Array:</strong> 1-2: Protectorate HQ, 3-4: The train yard, 5-6: Downtown [6] It takes place Downtown.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Right now, our group is seated outside a café in Downtown, waiting for the heroes to arrive. The café isn't open. Its windows are shattered, the door is blown in, and a wall is missing. The building is in much the same condition as its neighbors, since the luxurious Downtown got hit hardest during the Leviathan fight. However, the chairs on the patio miraculously escaped destruction, so we are seated here.</p>
		<p>My bugs feel them approaching. I look at Tattletale and give her a nod, and in return she gives me her vulpine grin. She's enjoying this. She better not get carried away.</p>
		<p>The heroes come into sight further down the sidewalk. It's a large group. Miss Militia is leading the team, as usual, with Assault and Battery on her wings and Triumph pulling up the rear. The current full Protectorate.</p>
		<p>Behind them are the junior heroes: Weld, Clockblocker, Vista, and Flechette. I grimace. When we last saw those four, we were attacking the Ward HQ while Regent piloted Shadow Stalker. I distinctly remember stinging Clockblocker and Flechette with capsaicin-laced hornets while making them choke on my swarm. No hard feelings, I hope.</p>
		<p>Pulling up the rear is Glory Girl. What is she doing here? She's a member of New Wave, not the Wards. Either way, I'm not happy to see her. The last time we met, we were robbing a bank and I was holding her sister hostage at knife point, and then after Tattletale threatened to destroy their family by revealing a deep dark secret, she shot Glory Girl. I'm fairly confident there <em>are</em> hard feelings there.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>How do they react to us?<br>
		  <strong>Initial Disposition:</strong> [Indifferent] Well, at least they're not upset.</p>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is Tattletale courteous? [96] That's going to be a no.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The heroes approach our table and loom over us. "Undersiders," Miss Militia states without emotion.</p>
		<p>"Yo, Militia! What brings you into our neck of the woods?" Tattletale asks with a grin. Her feet are kicked up on the table.</p>
		<p>Miss Militia levels a glare at her. "You do, Tattletale. Why did you contact us?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I try to get a word in before Tattletale.<br>
		  <strong>Secure an Advantage:</strong> (+2 edge) [5, 8 vs 7] Weak hit. Take +1 forward. I manage to speak before her but they're still suspicious.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"We're requesting assistance," I say before Tattletale can upset her further. </p>
		<p>"Assistance?" Battery asks in disbelief.</p>
		<p>"The Nine are murdering civilians left and right," I say, "and they're attempting to recruit new members. We need to get rid of them."</p>
		<p>"You mean kill them," Miss Militia says.</p>
		<p>"That would be best," Tattletale replies. "I know you have a kill order out on them, so even the white hats can get their hands dirty."</p>
		<p>Battery crosses her arms. "And you're, what? Proposing a truce?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," I say with a nod. "The Nine as a group are an S-Level threat, putting them on par with an Endbringer attack and justifying a truce between heroes and villains."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>I request a truce.<br>
		  <strong>Compel:</strong> (+2 heart, +1 forward) [10, 9 vs 9] Good lord. Burn 10 momentum (2) for a weak hit. They agree but there's drama and they set their own terms.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>"I hardly think they're Endbringer level," Glory Girl says, stepping out from behind the crowd.</p>
		<p>Tattletale gasps in mock surprise. "O.M.G. Is that Glory Hole?"</p>
		<p>I groan. I don't know why Tattletale is provoking the semi-invincible girl that can rip cars in half, but I'd really rather she wouldn't. The event at the bank was scary enough.</p>
		<p>Driving the stake through Glory Girl's heart, Tattletale asks with a grin, "How's your sister?"</p>
		<p>"You bitch!" Glory Girl stalks towards us but Weld holds out an arm to halt her movement. She turns on Weld, her face twisted in rage. "I can't work with her! I won't do it!"</p>
		<p>Shadow Stalker laughs. "What a drama queen."</p>
		<p>"Shadow Stalker?!" Clockblocker asks in surprise, apparently just noticing her at the table. "They're controlling her again?"</p>
		<p>She rolls her eyes. "I'm not being controlled, dumbass."</p>
		<p>"Prove it," Flechette demands. "What did we do on our last patrol?"</p>
		<p>"We saved a woman from would-be rapists. We disabled the rapists, then sat by and watched the woman beat the shit out of them. You whined like a bitch through all of it," she answers without emotion.</p>
		<p>"They were defenseless!" she counters.</p>
		<p>"She was taking back her power," Shadow Stalker returns with a glare.</p>
		<p>Flechette scowls but nods. "It's her."</p>
		<p>Miss Militia turns me with eyes wide. "You recruited Shadow Stalker?"</p>
		<p>I shrug a shoulder. "It's a work in progress."</p>
		<p>She shakes her head. "This isn't good, Skitter. We can't stand by while you recruit heroes to your ranks. And that's without touching upon the apparent conflict that your group has with one of our members."</p>
		<p>"Glory Hole is one of yours now?" Tattletale asks.</p>
		<p>"It's a work in progress," Miss Militia repeats my sentiment without looking at her, then returns to her accusation, "How did you expect this to go? Your group shows up, dangling a stolen member in front of us while antagonizing another, and that's supposed to persuade us to aid you?"</p>
		<p>I shake my head. "First off, we didn't steal her, you threw her away. Second, we're not requesting aid for us, we're requesting aid for the city."</p>
		<p>Assault scoffs. "That's rich. The villains are asking us to save the city. That's literally our job."</p>
		<p>"Then fucking do something!" I shout. I'm so sick of this shit. "You've stood by and done absolutely nothing while the Nine have destroyed what's left of our city. Do you even know how many of our civilians they've killed? Hundreds! And it's only been days since they've arrived."</p>
		<p>"Most of those were Merchants, though. They actually did us a favor," Imp interjects.</p>
		<p>I glare at Imp and Grue lightly slaps her on the back of the head. Imp feigns being critically injured and collapses to the ground in an overly dramatic fashion.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe these idiots seized control of the city," Clockblocker grumbles.</p>
		<p>Ignoring further comments from the peanut gallery, I look straight at Miss Militia. "I am formally requesting that you get off your asses and save the fucking city."</p>
		<p>"That's enough, Skitter. You've made your point," Miss Militia says. "We'll assist. But we have conditions."</p>
		<p>"And those are?" Tattletale asks.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>What are their terms?<br>
		  <strong>Action+Theme:</strong> [Escort Honor] They want to take lead and to work out of their base.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Miss Militia says in a firm tone, "If we are to combine forces, the heroes will take lead. We can't have the villians calling the shots."</p>
		<p>Tattletale sits up straight. "No way—"</p>
		<p>I cut her off by holding up a hand. "No, it's fine. It's just like an Endbringer attack. As long as it gets done, I don't care who's in command." I look straight at Miss Militia. "But you will listen to us. We have better information and a greater stake in this than you."</p>
		<p>"We are aware of your impressive level of intel." Miss Militia glances at Tattletale and she grins in response. She sighs and continues, "I agree that it would be foolish to not take advantage of whatever you can share."</p>
		<p>"Then, I believe we're in agreement…?" I venture, turning to the Undersiders.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Ask the Oracle:</strong> Is everyone on board? (Almost Certain) [49] Yes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The group alternates between cautious nods and shrugs of indifference. Good enough, I guess.</p>
		<p>"Then it's settled," Miss Militia says. "We will discuss this with our supervisors and then contact you soon."</p>
		<p>"We'll be waiting," I reply. </p>
		<p>Miss Militia nods, then turns and walks away. The rest of her group follows. Glory Girl keeps glaring at Tattletale from over her shoulder as Vista pats her on the back, both in comfort and to guide her away from us.</p>
		<p>This collaboration will probably be a disaster.</p>
