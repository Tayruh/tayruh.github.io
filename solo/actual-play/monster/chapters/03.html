		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun, Finola, and I retraced our steps to the front door of the grocery store, and after ensuring that Finola was still tucked away out of sight, we entered the building.</p>
		<p>The Village Market had always felt charming and cozy to me. The store's interior design gave the impression of a ski lodge converted into a food mart, with its floor, support beams, and ceiling styled in simple varnished wood, complimented by walls painted in off-white. All that was missing to complete the decor was a stone fireplace. Overall the small shop felt warm and welcoming, which was also an apt description of its owners, Thomas and Anna Rosenthal.</p>
		<p>To the right of the entrance, Anna worked the cash register from behind the checkout counter. The woman was beautiful, though short-statured, and resembled a matured version of Melody, with chestnut-brown hair like her daughter's, that flowed down her back to her waist. She greeted us with a friendly smile and wave as we passed her, before returning her attention to the short line of customers in front of her.</p>
		<p>I grabbed a small shopping cart and headed toward the chips and crackers aisle with Seoyun in tow. Erin had probably finished decorating the dining room by now, so we needed to grab our supplies and hurry back before she began to worry.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything interesting happen while we're shopping? (50/50) Otherwise I'll quickly summarize the scene. [74] Yes.<br>
		  <strong>Meaning:</strong> What is it? [Actions: Use Expectation] Melody returns to the shop. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I snagged a bag of chips that I knew to be Erin's favorite and I tossed it into the cart. Finola piped up that she wanted caramel popcorn, so I dropped a bag of that into the cart as well. I turned to ask Seoyun what she would like, and I froze at the sight behind her.</p>
		<p>Melody entered the store from the door in back.</p>
		<p>Seoyun raised an eyebrow at me, but I didn't respond as I watched Melody. The poor girl struggled to close the door. She looked weak and ill. Melody had removed her wig since we last saw her, and her curly hair was a mess, frizzed with static in spots and matted down in others. Her forehead glistened with a sheen of sweat and she wobbled as she stood, as though a gentle breeze could knock her over.</p>
		<p>Seoyun followed my eyes toward the back door, then her eyes brightened and her lips curved into a vulpine grin. "This should be fun." </p>
		<p>I grimaced at her and she happily turned that grin on me. I knew that Seoyun enjoyed putting me on the spot, but it bothered me that she really didn't care at all that she had hurt Melody.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Melody remember me being there? (50/50) [22][Event Focus: Current Context][Actions: Oppose Possessions] Yes. Melody also takes issue with me being with Seoyun, thinking we're a couple.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It didn't take long before Melody's gaze fell upon me. Her face immediately scrunched up into a scowl. Seoyun kept grinning, like this were the most entertaining thing in the world to her, as Melody stumbled her way toward us on shaky legs.</p>
		<p>Though I felt guilty for my part in what Seoyun had done to her, I couldn't undo the damage, nor could I explain to her what had happened. The best course of action was to keep my head down, so I pretended not to notice Melody approaching and returned my focus to shopping.</p>
		<p>Melody slapped her hands down on the low shelving separating us. "You. What did you do to me?"</p>
		<p>I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye as I continued placing items in my cart. "What are you talking about?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Seth:</strong> Begin contest. I feign ignorance. (Never Enough for Father d8, Melody d4, Presence d8) [8, 4, 4] = 12 (d8)</p>
		  <p><strong>Melody:</strong> She tries to read me. (Difficulty 2d8, Sheltered Girl d6, Observant d8) [3, 5, 2, 4] = 8 (d8). Failure. End contest. Take <em>Insecure d8</em> stress.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Melody narrowed her eyes as she scrutinized me. "I saw you."</p>
		<p>"Melody." I caught Seoyun's expression in my peripheral as I turned to face Melody. The smug kumiho had toned her grin down to a mere smirk. "You really need to be more specific. You saw me where? Doing what?"</p>
		<p>"In the back!" Melody stomped her foot in frustration, catching the attention of a few shoppers. She blushed, then lowered her voice as she continued, "You, uh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't know what you did, you pervert, but you were the last thing I saw before I woke up on the ground."</p>
		<p>I blinked slowly and just stared at Melody with an expression that read "Are you stupid?" The young girl withered a little under my glare and looked away. I felt bad, but what else could I do but make her doubt herself?</p>
		<p>Seoyun stepped up and wrapped her arms around me from behind, and smiled over my shoulder at Melody. "Oh, sweetie, I get it. Believe me." She planted a kiss on my cheek, with a loud smack of her lips for dramatic effect. "I dream of this hunk 'a man nightly, too."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does this anger Melody? (Likely) Otherwise she feels defeated. [87] No. She doubts herself.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Melody frowned as she looked from Seoyun, to me, and then back. The anger faded from her expression and was replaced by resignation.</p>
		<p>"No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you're right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a probably just a dream." Melody paused, then shuddered. "Ugh. Why am I dreaming of Seth? Gross."</p>
		<p>"Hey!" I retorted. My sympathy for this girl was dwindling quickly.</p>
		<p>Melody completely ignored me and turned her attention to Seoyun. "What are you doing with this loser, anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Loser?" Seoyun hugged me tighter. I can't say that I hated the feeling. "Surely you're not referring to my sweet hunny bunny snookem wookems."</p>
		<p>Melody made a choking sound and gagged, as if she had swallowed a bug.</p>
		<p>I sighed and began trudging forward with my shopping cart, moving away from Melody. "If you don't mind, people are waiting for us and we still have shopping to do."</p>
		<p>Seoyun annoyingly refused to let go of me, so it was a very awkward shuffle down the aisle, but I was slowly making progress. I really just wanted to get back to the boardinghouse and not deal Seoyun's games or Melody's attitude anymore.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Melody follow us? (50/50) [92] No. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Melody didn't follow, apparently no longer seeing the point in pursuing us or the conversation. "Whatever. I'm going home, anyway. I feel like I got hit by a bus."</p>
		<p>"Bye, Melody," Seoyun called in a sing-song voice. "Hope you feel better."</p>
		<p>I gave Melody a half-assed wave over my shoulder. "Later."</p>
		<p>Melody ignored me again and waved good-bye to Seoyun, then she slogged her way toward the front of the store, looking as though she were running on empty. I was happy to be out from under Melody's scrutiny, but I really did hope that she'd recover quickly.</p>
		<p>Anna's eyes widened when she saw the state of her daughter, and she excused herself from her line of customers to intercept her. Anna put an arm around Melody and leaned into her with a look of concern on her face as she spoke to her daughter in a hushed tone that I couldn't hear from where I stood.</p>
		<p>Seoyun's eyes were locked on the mother and daughter. She continued to lean against my back, with her arms wrapped around me and her chin resting on my shoulder. Her soft lips were turned up in a satisfied smile.</p>
		<p>I frowned at her expression. "You seem pleased with yourself."</p>
		<p>Her eyes practically sparkled as she looked up at me, digging her fingertips into my side possessively. "Very."</p>
		<p>"You aren't bothered that you left Melody looking like the walking dead?" I asked her.</p>
		<p>"Why should I be? She's just food."</p>
		<p>"And what am I?"</p>
		<p>Seoyun chuckled softly, then whispered, her breath hot against my ear, "You're the grand feast."</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does anything interesting happen before we leave? (Unlikely) [70] Nope. Time to blow this popsicle stand.</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p>I was about to respond to Seoyun's comment when my cellphone began buzzing in my pocket. I narrowed my eyes at her as I retrieved my phone, then glanced at the display. Erin.</p>
		<p>Answering the call, I said, "Hey. What's up?"</p>
		<p>"Seth!" my sister's voice crackled through the phone speaker. Being surrounded by forest in a valley in the middle of absolutely nowhere did a number on the cell reception in Forest Glen. "I need you to do me a huuuge favor!"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?" I prompted her while looking at Seoyun.</p>
		<p>She shrugged in response, and it occurred to me that I didn't know whether Seoyun still had preternatural hearing while she assumed human ears. She could have listened in to the phone conversation with her typical canine ears, even over the sounds of the pouring rain beating down on the roof above us.</p>
		<p>Erin asked, "Can you go to that little electronics store in town and grab us a video projector? I thought it'd be nice to show some home videos during our celebration."</p>
		<p>I sighed. I wasn't looking forward to doing more running around, but home videos did sound like a good idea. "Yeah, fine. It shouldn't take us long."</p>
		<p>"Awesome! You're the best!" Erin chirped in my ear. "Love you!"</p>
		<p>"Love you, too," I replied, and my sister ended the call.</p>
		<br>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does the rain ease off? (50/50) [41] Yes. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The rain had tapered off before we finished shopping, which made loading the car with our purchased goods far less miserable than I was expecting. Though, with the rain now dissipating, children and their parents had begun leaving the comfort of their homes to engage in some much anticipated trick-or-treating, which created a new kind of driving hazard and I had to be careful not to run over any costumed munchkins on the way to our destination. Thankfully, our local quirky electronics store was located only a few streets away from the Village Market, so the trip was quite short.</p>
		<p>Moments later, we were greeted by the bright green sign of the shop, declaring itself "Glen Gadgets and Gizmos," though the locals affectionately referred to it as "G3." The building was shamefully small, nondescript aside from its sign, and its parking was nearly non-existent. I pulled into one of only three spots reserved for the store, right next to the owner's car.</p>
		<p>Seoyun and I got out of my car, and before I could complete my now routine check to ensure that Finola was behaving herself like a good little passenger in my hood, I was nearly trampled by a horde of zombies. Very short zombies carrying bright orange plastic jack-o-lantern trick-or-treat buckets, and giggling and shrieking excitedly as they ran a few paces ahead of their supervising adults. The children's guardians gave me an embarrassed smile and apology when they walked past.</p>
		<p>I turned to Seoyun, who said nothing while she simply grinned at me. She was enjoying herself at my expense, as usual. I sighed, then said, "C'mon. Let's get this over with so we can head back."</p>
		<p>I pulled open the door to the little shop, which the rang the chime hung above it. I stepped inside and Seoyun trailed after me.</p>
		<p>G3 was practically the only place in town where you could purchase televisions, computers, or pretty much anything that supported living in the modern world. Despite that, the electronics store was uncomfortably small. I suspected that the sales floor was smaller than our dining room at the boardinghouse. However, what it lacked in real estate, it made up for in density. The shelves were packed so tight, and the floor was so crowded, that the shop resembled the abandoned attic of a hoarder.</p>
		<p>Navigating the maze of shelving and stacks of electronics, we managed to locate the sales counter and the young man running this eccentric establishment. </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Has the owner met Seoyun before? (50/50) [87] No.<br>
		  <strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does he swoon over her? (50/50) [9] Exception yes. Yiiikes.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The store's owner and sole employee, Kyle Attenborough, stood behind the counter, fiddling with some disassembled gadget strewn across the counter top. He hunched over it like he were performing an autopsy. I couldn't say what it originally used to be as it was just a jumble of parts now.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Kyle," I said as we neared the counter.</p>
		<p>He replied without looking up, "Hey, Seth. Gimme a second."</p>
		<p>Kyle peered through his coke-bottle glasses at the gutted gadget. He was carefully trying to finesse a screw out of a space too tight for fingers using the tip of a tiny magnetic screwdriver. Curls of his unkempt red hair kept falling into his face. He would blow a puff of air to clear his view, then they would fall right back. I would have been growling in frustration, but he took it all in stride.</p>
		<p>I waited patiently while he worked. Seoyun, though, took the opportunity to poke around the shop since this was her first time here. She didn't leave the boardinghouse often, and when she did, it was usually just to help with grocery shopping.</p>
		<p>Finally, Kyle accomplished his surgical task and placed the screwdriver on the counter. "Phew. Thanks for waiting. What can I do for you, buddy?"</p>
		<p>I smiled. Kyle and I weren't close friends, but I was a regular and we got along well enough. "I was wondering if you had a video projector hidden somewhere in this mess."</p>
		<p>He snorted. "Yeah, of course. It's in the back, right next to the—"</p>
		<p>Kyle froze mid-sentence, like a powered-down animatronic, when Seoyun had turned to look at him. It was clearly lust at first sight. Seoyun grinned at him mischievously, her eyes promising things that she would never deliver.</p>
		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Kyle."</p>
		<p>"Huh. What?" Kyle strained to move his eyes from Seoyun and back to me, as though it required physical effort. I was beginning to believe that Seoyun exuded some sort of magic or pheromone that drew people to her. She was absolutely gorgeous, but the pull she had felt unnatural.</p>
		<p>"The projector?" I reminded him.</p>
		<p>He blinked, clearing the fog. "Right. Right, of course. It's in the aisle to the right of the televisions." He pointed without looking at the aisle directly behind Seoyun.</p>
		<p>I thanked him and headed in the direction that he indicated. As I passed Seoyun, she remained firmly rooted, apparently trying to seduce the poor shopkeeper from across the room.</p>
		<p>I stopped and turned back toward her. "Seoyun?"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does she stay behind? (50/50) [65] Yep. RIP Kyle.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>When she refused to look away from Kyle, I spoke in a low voice, "You've already had your one for the day."</p>
		<p>She clucked her tongue. "I know, but let me have my fun."</p>
		<p>I looked back toward the counter while I considered. Kyle was doing his best to concentrate on his task despite fighting the urge to gaze at the kumiho.</p>
		<p>"You shouldn't play with your food, Seoyun."</p>
		<p>Seoyun laughed at that, then kissed me on the cheek, taking my reluctance to deny her as consent. She left me standing there as she practically skipped toward poor Kyle, providing me with even more incentive to grab the projector and get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p>Leaving Seoyun behind, I stepped into the back aisle that Kyle had indicated.</p>
		<p>I sighed in exasperation at the disaster laid before me. The overflowing shelving was buried beneath so much junk that the entangled devices appeared to be suspended in air. I wasn't even sure where to begin looking. </p>
		<p>As I started digging through the mess, Finola hopped up onto my shoulder.</p>
		<p>"She's gonna kill that guy, you know," she teased.</p>
		<p>I scoffed. "What are you, the devil on my shoulder?"</p>
		<p>"No." Finola put her hands on her hips and jutted her chin in mock indignation. "I'm your angel, silly."</p>
		<p>"Lord, help me."</p>
		<p>The little faerie cackled and batted at my ear. "No, seriously though, are you sure about leaving Seoyun with that man?"</p>
		<p>I looked up from my search to glance in the direction of the sales counter, not that I could see it through the aisles of devices stacked upon one another.</p>
		<p>"It's fine. She's already fed and just wants to toy with the innocent fool." I returned to moving the electronics around on the shelving in the hope of finding my quarry buried beneath the surface. I mumbled, mostly to myself, "It'll be good for her to expend that energy on someone that isn't me for once."</p>
		<p>Finola snickered. "It must be rough having a mega-hottie drooling all over you."</p>
		<p>I chose not to respond.</p>
		<p>It's not that I didn't like Seoyun. She was generally pleasant to be around, when she wasn't flirting with me mercilessly, and she was in fact drop dead gorgeous. But, it was the "drop dead" bit that concerned me, even before accounting for the fact that her true form wasn't even human. I honestly couldn't tell how much she desired me as a lover, and how much she desired me as a meal. I often thought the only thing that prevented her from doing to me what she had done to Melody was my position as housemaster for the boardinghouse providing shelter for her.</p>
		<p>Although, considering that Melody had lost all memory of Seoyun's presence during the event, I now questioned whether Seoyun had never actually done that to me before .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
		<p>I glanced in the direction of the sales counter again, and began sifting through my memories for any recollection of my sister or me being deathly ill.</p>
		<p>"Hey! Earth to loverboy!" Finola shouted in my ear.</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Does Finola find the projector? (50/50) Otherwise I do. [27] Yes, she does.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I let out a irritated sigh. "What?"</p>
		<p>"Hey." She slapped my ear. "You're being a jerk. What's wrong with you?"</p>
		<p>I sagged my shoulders a little and frowned. "Sorry. It's nothing."</p>
		<p>Finola side-eyed me. "Whatever," she grumbled after a moment. "Anyway, isn't that what we're looking for?"</p>
		<p>She pointed with her itty bitty finger toward the end of the shelving. Sure enough, I could see what appeared to be the box to a video projector poking out from beneath a pile of coaxial cables and what I think was a betamax player. </p>
		<p>I dug out the box and inspected it. The projector seemed simple enough to run. A streaming device just needed to be connected to it using the included video cable and it would be good to go. Even my technologically challenged sister should be able to handle that.</p>
		<p>"Thank God. This looks like the one," I said.</p>
		<p>"Huzzah! Now to rescue our dear shopkeep!" Finola exclaimed happily and thrust her finger toward our destination. "Sally forth, my trusty steed!"</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p><strong>Fate Chart:</strong> Has Kyle submitted to Seoyun? (Unlikely) Otherwise she has him wrapped around her finger. [65] No. Good job, Kyle.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I tucked the projector box under my arm, and without having to remind her, the little faerie tucked herself away in my hood. I left the aisle and walked toward the counter, fully expecting Kyle to be at the mercy of Seoyun.</p>
		<p>To my surprise, Kyle was still resisting the kumiho's attempts at seduction, or whatever she was trying to do. The man was expending so much effort to keep his gaze trained on his repair project that it looked like he was trying to burn a hole through the gadget with his eyes. Seoyun, on the other hand, was casually leaning her elbow against the counter top with her chin resting in her hand, so close to Kyle that she could have kissed his cheek. Kyle's brow shined with perspiration.</p>
		<p>I stepped up to the counter and placed the box on top. "I found it."</p>
		<p>Kyle put his screwdriver down and looked up at me with an expression of utter gratitude for his rescue. "That's great." He cleared his throat and awkwardly sidestepped toward the cash register, moving away from Seoyun. "Let me get you cashed out."</p>
		<p>Seoyun remained leaning where she was against the counter. Her eyes flicked to me with a look of irritation. It seemed that I had returned too soon and ruined her fun. Too bad. She and Jess were the only two residents of the boardinghouse that could mingle with the common folk without anyone suspecting their true nature. It wasn't my fault that Seoyun never chose to enter town unless it was with me. I wasn't her keeper.</p>
		<p>Kyle did his best to pretend that Seoyun wasn't in the room while he quickly but politely rang up our purchase. Kyle and I usually made small talk whenever I would buy from him, but today he was the most efficient I'd ever seen. It was obvious how much his reaction to Seoyun unnerved him and he wanted to be away from her as soon as possible. I couldn't say that I blamed him.</p>
		<p>Once the sale was complete, Kyle practically pushed us out the door, albeit with a strained smile.</p>
		<p>My kumiho companion, my faerie stowaway, and I found ourselves in the cold, wet night air once again. The rain had stopped entirely now, but the puddles and slick pavement would likely remain until the morning. The trick-or-treaters didn't seem to mind, however. I could see a few of the children across the street purposefully stomp through the puddles on their way to the next house. They giggled like mad as they tried to create the biggest splash that they could, completely oblivious to how they had just missed drenching their parents, who were looking less thrilled.</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p>Seoyun and I walked the short distance to my car. She didn't say a word or even look at me as she got in and buckled up.</p>
		<p>I could tell that Seoyun was still upset, but I was pretty positive that she wasn't upset at me, just the situation. Given a bit more time, Kyle would have been hers, but she couldn't have expected me to just pass the time in the back of the shop while waiting for him to become putty in her hands. Even as selfish as she could be, she had to know that would be unreasonable.</p>
		<p>The drive back to the boardinghouse was in silence. Seoyun remained quiet as she stared out the passenger window, I'd never been one for conversation, especially when starting one might make the mood worse, and even Finola seemed to think pressing Seoyun's buttons would be a bad idea. So we both let Seoyun recover her bruised ego from Kyle not having rolled over for her the instant that she turned eyes on him.</p>
		<p>Besides, it was nearly time for our celebration to be underway, and I had a feeling that this would be the least of the damage control that I'd have to do before the night was up.</p>
