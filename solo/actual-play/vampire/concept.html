<li>Where does the story begin? [Enemy Artilliary] Vincent finds
Katherine in a church after a massacre.</li>
<li>Were her parents killed? [Yes] Yes, her parents are dead.</li>
<li>Was this during the massacre? [No] No, this was years ago.</li>
<li>Was she living in the church? [Yes, and] Yes, and the priest was her
uncle. He took her in after her parents died.</li>
<li>Is she religious also? (Probably Not) [No] No, it was just room and
board for her. She planned on leaving as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Was Vincent in the squad that killed the church members? [Yes, and
unexpectedly] Yes, and he even lead the charge.</li>
<li>Does Vincent know why the girl is wanted? (Maybe Not) [No] Nope,
he's just following orders.</li>
<li>Where is the vampire coven? [Secretively Evasive; Festively Cruel]
It tends to move around, but it's currently based under a holiday themed
shop. It's nearly Christmas so that's the current theme.</li>
<li>Was there a large squad that came with Vincent? (Mixed-1, But/And,
Danger) [0, 4, 4] It was very small. There was resistance but it wasn't
too dangerous.</li>
<li>Was it just Vincent? (Yes/And+2, Straight, Favorability) [7, 3, 2]
Yes, and he was more than enough. However, it wasn't supposed to be a
bloodbath, but he was discovered and had to defend himself.</li>
<li>Does Katherine care that her uncle is dead? (Mixed, Straight, Drama)
[4, 3, 1] It doesn't really bother her and she doesn't even hold it
against Vincent.</li>
<li>Was the uncle abusing her? (Mixed, Straight) [3, 2] He might have
been a little bit.</li>
<li>How does Katherine feel towards Vincent? (Curiosity, Aggressiveness,
Cooperation) [2, 4, 4] She doesn't really care that he's a vampire. She
didn't care for her uncle and isn't upset that she's dead, so she just
follows Vincent for now. She's fairly cooperative but she also snaps
back whenever she feels insulted or threatened.</li>
